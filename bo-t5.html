Rashi comments: "and warn him." Now it seems that he warned him about
the plague of locusts. But if so, why did the Eternal say "for I have
hardened his heart" (כִּי אֲנִי הִכְבַּדְתִּי אֶת לִבּוֹ)? Why would G-d have told
Moses to warn Pharaoh about the plague of the locusts just because He
had hardened Pharaoh's heart? There are some commentaries that interpret
the words "for I have hardened his heart" as being part of the warning
to Pharaoh. In other words, Moses was supposed to tell Pharaoh that G-d
was causing him not to send the people out of Egypt. So the meaning of
the verse would be "Go to Pharaoh" to warn him that "it is I Who have
hardened his heart." In that case, Pharaoh would send the people out to
prove to Moses that he had spoken falsely and that Pharoah was not
controlled by G-d. This would also be the explanation of "I have mocked
Egypt" (אֲשֶׁר הִתְעַלַּלְתִּי בְּמִצְרַיִם). Although this interpretation is
correct, it implies that the warning to Pharaoh was not for the plague
of the locusts, because Pharaoh received a separate warning for that
plague. If so, one may ask why this warning to tell Pharaoh that G-d had
hardened his heart was different from the other warnings which were all
associated with a specific plague, while this warning was independent of
any plague.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It therefore appears to our master that this warning was actually
connected to the plague of hail, since Moses, in connection with that
plague, had told Pharaoh, after being asked to pray to G-d for an end to
the thunder and the hail (Exodus 9:29-30): "As soon as I am gone out of
the city, I will spread my hands unto the Lord . . . But as for thee and
thy servants, I know that ye will not yet be afraid of the Lord G-d."
These words hardened the heart of Pharaoh who therefore concluded that
the time had come when the hail would cease on its own in the normal
course of events and that the Moses's prayer had accomplished nothing.
For if the hail would not have ceased on its own without Moses's
intervention, Pharaoh reasoned, what was the point of Moses's praying
for us? If Moses knew that we would not believe in or fear the Lord even
after the hail ceased, why would he pray for us? Because this was what
Pharaoh was thinking, G-d commanded Moses to set Pharaoh's teeth on edge
and to tell him, "I have allowed his heart to be hardened" (אֲנִי
הִכְבַּדְתִּי אֶת לִבּוֹ) and have given him the opportunity to go astray "in
order that I might set these signs in his midst" (לְמַעַן שִׁתִי אֹתֹתַי אֵלֶּה,
בְּקִרְבּוֹ)

One may ask why the Scripture writes the word "נֵלֵךְ" (we will go)
twice and why Pharaoh in responding also says (Exodus 10:11) "go now you
who are men" (לְכוּ נָא הַגְּבָרִים) . . . for that is what ye desire" (כִּי
אֹתָהּ אַתֶּם מְבַקְשִׁים). Rashi explains Pharaoh's response to mean: "for
that is what you have sought until now, 'let us sacrifice to our G-d'
(נִזְבְּחָה לֵאלֹקֵינוּ), and it is not the custom of little children to
sacrifice." But if Pharaoh was willing to send the adults to perform
sacrifices but wished only to hold back the small children, why then did
he insist on keeping the cattle also? How were the Israelites to bring
sacrifices if they could take no cattle with them? Nor could it be that
when Pharaoh said "go now you who are men" he meant to hold back only
their children, but not their cattle and sheep, because after the plague
of darkness, when Pharaoh changed the heart of stone within him to a
heart of flesh, and agreed to let the sons and daughters go as well, he
still insisted that their cattle be held back as it is written (Exodus
10:24): "only let your flocks and your herds remain behind: let your
little ones also go with you" (רַק צֹאנְכֶם וּבְקַרְכֶם  יֻצָּג גַּם-טַפְּכֶם יֵלֵךְ
עִמָּכֶם).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And it appears to our master that in the earlier generations when Israel
dwelt in Egypt, the Gentiles were worshiping their G-ds not only by
bringing sacrifices from cattle and sheep, but also by offering their
own sons and daughters as sacrifices to their G-ds. Now the Eternal also
commanded our fathers in Egypt to worship him in two ways that were
similar: the Pascal offering, which was a sheep, and circumcision, which
is like a human sacrifice. The Kabbalah, in fact, interprets the verse
(Psalms 44:23) "But for Your sake we are killed all day long" 
(כִּיעָלֶיךָ הֹרַגְנוּ כָל הַיּוֹם) 
as a reference to circumcision. And in the merit of
these two commandments, they were redeemed as it is written (Ezekiel
16:6) "And when I passed by you, and saw you weltering in your own
blood, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to
you when you were in your blood, Live!" (וָאֶעֱבֹר עָלַיִךְ וָאֶרְאֵךְ מִתְבּוֹסֶסֶת
בְּדָמָיִךְ וָאֹמַר לָךְ בְּדָמַיִךְ חֲיִי וָאֹמַר לָךְ בְּדָמַיִךְ חֲיִי). The repetition of the 
word "your blood" (בְּדָמַיִךְ)
refers to the blood of the Pascal offering and to the blood of the
circumcision.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now we know that the Eternal initially did not want to command our
fathers to offer sacrifices, for does the Eternal want sacrifices?
"Behold to obey is better than sacrifice" (הִנֵּה שְׁמֹעַ מִזֶּבַח טוֹב)
(1 Samuel 15:22). And that is true for everyone, as Jeremiah, G-d's
prophet, cried (Jeremiah 7:22-23): "For in the day that I brought them
out of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning
burnt-offerings or sacrifices. But this thing I commanded them, saying,
Obey my voice, and I will be your G-d, and you shall be my people." It
was only after they sinned at Horeb and made the golden calf that the
Eternal commanded them to build the Tabernacle and an altar on which to
sacrifice fat and blood. How great was the effort of Moses, the faithful
shepherd, to lift up Israel upon the platform of faith and knowledge so
that they could all become a treasured people, a commonwealth of priests
and a holy nation, to worship the Eternal with their heart and their
soul, and to hear His voice. If they had done so they would not have
needed to serve Him with the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of
calves. But the children of Israel were still ignorant and their heart
was too dense to be penetrated.

When Moses said: "We will go with our young and with our old" to worship
G-d, he did not make clear how they were going to worship Him. So when
he said: "With our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
our herds we will go" meaning that we will take sacrifices from the
flocks and herds to worship Him, Pharaoh misunderstood Moses. Thinking
that Moses wanted to accustom the people to perform the abominations of
Egypt and to offer human sacrifices, Pharaoh responded: "go now you who
are men, and serve the Lord" without sacrificing sheep or your sons and
daughters. Pharaoh then added: "for that is what you desire" 
(כִּי אֹתָהּ אַתֶּם מְבַקְשִׁים), 
by which he meant: what you really want is to instruct
the people in a form of service to G-d that does not involve sacrifice
of any kind, because the true sacrifice to G-d consists in a broken
spirit. Moses could not reply at all to this, because he was immediately
driven from Pharaoh's presence. Not until after the plague of darkness
when Pharaoh said "let also your little ones go with you, only let your
flocks and your herds remain behind," could Moses reply that they
certainly knew that the G-d of the Hebrews did not want any human
sacrifice, which is an abomination unto G-d, so they would bring
sacrifices only from their cattle to worship Him. And concerning the
earlier remark of Pharaoh that what they really desired was to worship
the Eternal without sacrifice of any kind, Moses now replied, "and we do
not know with what we must serve the Lord until we arrive" 
(וַאֲנַחְנוּ לֹא נֵדַע מַה נַּעֲבֹד אֶת יְהוָה עַד בֹּאֵנוּ שָׁמָּה). 
Moses meant to say
that until we reach the spiritual level that we are seeking, we will not
know how to serve G-d in any way other than by sacrifices. And see what
a forced interpretation Rashi offered in his commentary on 
"וַאֲנַחְנוּ לֹא נֵדַע".
