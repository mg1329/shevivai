  And it came to pass after two full years (Genesis 41:1)

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  These two years were counted from the day that the chief butler left
  prison, which was Pharaoh's birthday. From that moment, two
  additional years were added to Joseph's captivity, because he placed
  his trust in the chief butler, believing that the butler would make
  favorable mention of him to the king. The birthday of Pharaoh was a
  day designated for him to recognize his servants either for pardon
  or punishment, as he did with the chief butler and the chief baker.
  Joseph therefore said to the butler "but remember me" 
  (כי אם זכרתני) 
  "and make mention of me to Pharaoh" (והזכרתני אל פרעה), 
  by which he meant that if the chief butler would remember
  him until the next year, the butler would then be able to make
  favorable mention of him to Pharaoh. But "the chief butler did not
  remeber Joseph," (ולא זכר שר המשקים את יוסף). Why?
  Because "he forgot him" (וישכחהו) within the year that
  passed. Joseph hoped fervently that, at the next birthday of
  Pharaoh, the chief butler would speak well of him to the king. But
  because Joseph placed his trust in a mortal, he was forgotten like a
  dead person by the chief butler who made no mention of him. Joseph
  therefore stayed an extra year in jail and only after his hopes that
  the chief butler would help were completely disappointed, did
  Ha-Sheim Yitbarakh arrange for him to be mentioned the following
  year (i.e, after two full years) on the birthday of Pharaoh. But the
  chief butler mentioned Joseph not for Joseph's sake, but for the
  king's whose spirit was troubled by his dream. The extension of his
  captivity was, therefore, meant to teach Joseph to place his trust
  only in G-d, and not to seek elsewhere for deliverance, which is why
  it says "two years of days" (שנתיים ימים).

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  But it is astonishing that G-d would consider it a sin for Joseph to
  try to free himself from captivity. Is that not called wisdom and
  does G-d not promise "and I will bless you in all that you shall do"
  (וברכך ה' אלוקיך בכל אשר תעשה)? And if, nevertheless,
  salvation belongs to G-d, we human beings are required to do what we
  can. However, Joseph the righteous was different, because he was
  schooled in miracles and was entirely under Divine Providence beyond
  the bounds of nature, as was the case when he was thrown into the
  pit, and when he was in the house of his Egyptian master and G-d was
  with him in all that he did. And while Joseph was imprisoned,
  whichever way he turned, G-d made him successful. One such as this
  should have cast his burden only to G-d. For Joseph to have relied
  on human agency was, therefore, a sin only for him.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  This is also the meaning of the Midrash on the verse "And it came to
  pass after two full years" which states that the verse (Psalms
  40:5): "Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust who does not
  turn to the proud to those who go astray after false G-ds" 
  ( אשרי הגבר אשר שם ה' מבטחו ולא פנה אל רהבים) 
  (Psalms 40:5) refers to Joseph. But because he did turn to
  the proud when he said "remember me" (ki im z'khartani) and "make
  mention of me" (v'hizkartani) two years were added to his captivity.
  This is astonishing. But the Midrash meant to say that every person
  must trust in G-d, but may also seek aid wherever it may be found,
  provided that he attributes the aid to Divine Providence. But
  blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust without any
  intermediary. Joseph was one like this, and therefore should not
  have turned for aid to the proud.

       וטבוח טבח והכן 

</span></p><p><span class="c2">	

       And slaughter an animal and make ready (Genesis 47:16)

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  Rashi comments:this is the same as "and to slaughter and to prepare"
  (וטבוח טבח והכן). The word "וטבוח" is not an imperative,
  for the imperative would be "וטבח".


</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  See the Tosafot (חולין דף צא ע"א ד"ה כמאן דאמר כיד הנשה) and the
  Maharshah who say that while "וטבוח" is not an imperative,
  "והכן" is an imperative. And it appears to our master that
  since the brothers fulfilled the commandment of shehitah, they would
  not eat meat slaughtered by a Noahide, because an animal slaughtered
  by a gentile is considered to be neveilah. Joseph therefore did not
  say to his gentile servant "slaughter" (וטבח), he said to him
  "וטבוח" i.e., to prepare the animal's throat for one of the
  brothers to perform the shehitah himself. But Joseph did command the
  servant to prepare animal to be eaten after shehitah, using the
  imperative form "והכן" which meant that the servant himself
  should remove the sciatic nerve (גיד הנשה).


</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  This is an appropriate place to mention that our master was
  astounded by how the Rambam in his commentary on the Mishnah 
  (Hulin  7:6; 100b) explains the reply of the Sages to R. Judah that the law
  of the sciatic nerve was ordained on Mount Sinai, but was written in
  its proper place (i.e., in the narrative concerning Jacob (Genesis
  32:33)


</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  The Rambam explains that the Sages meant that we fulfill this
  commandment only because we were commanded to do so at Sinai, not
  because of any previous commandment. But if this is what the Sages
  meant, then even the Sages who dispute the opinion of R. Judah
  (i.e., that the prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve applies
  to all animals) agree that the children of Jacob were prohibited to
  eat the sciatic nerve. This is problematic, because the Gemara
  (Hulin 91a) cites the opinion that when Joseph said "and prepare"
  (v'hakhein) it means that he ordered the servant to remove the
  sciatic nerve in the sight of Joseph's brothers. The Gemara states
  that this interpretation of the verse accords with the opinion that
  the prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve applied to the
  children of Jacob when they were just Noahides (i.e., the opinion of
  R. Judah). But, according to the Rambam's interpretation of the
  opinion of the Sages who argue with R. Judah, there is no dispute
  that children of Jacob did not eat the sciatic nerve. So why did the
  Gemara say that the interpretation of the verse accords with the
  opinion that the brothers did not eat the sciatic nerve, which
  suggests that there is a contrary opinion?
