חַג הַסֻּכֹּת תַּעֲשֶׂה לְךָ שִׁבְעַת יָמִים </span>(דברים טז, יג)
</p>  <p><span class="c2"> 

A festival of sukkot you shall make for yourself for seven days.      
   </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> 
The Sifri explains that the words "חַג הַסֻּכֹּת תַּעֲשֶׂה לְךָ" (a festival of
sukkot for yourself) teach us that the sukkot are "להדיוט," i.e., for
mundane purposes. But the Sifri then asks how we know that the sukkot
are also "לגבוה" i.e., for sacred purposes. From another verse, 
״חַג הַסֻּכּוֹת שִׁבְעַת יָמִים לד׳״(אלקיך)" (the festival of sukkot,
seven days for the Lord your G-d) (Leviticus 23:34). But then the
question arises why, if the sukkot are for sacred purposes, does the
Scripture also say that the sukkot are for you (לְךָ)? To teach us that
even if you make the sukkah for yourself, G-d considers the sukkah to
have been made for His sake.
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
Our master explained the meaning of the Sifri as follows. During the
harvest season, when a man gathers his crops, the fruits of all his
labor, from the field, it is easy to delude himself and to bless himself
in his heart, saying: "my hands have made all of this." And lest one
exalt his heart and trust in his abundant wealth, we were commanded to
fulfill, during harvest time, the commandment of the sukkah, which
rouses our hearts to recognize that we require Divine Providence and
that all the blessings that come to our homes have come to us from His
hand.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
One might think that all this relates only to material possessions,
landed estates, gold and silver treasures, ivory palaces, and all
objects of worldly desire. But concerning Torah and mitzvot, charity and
kindness, fear of the Almighty and good deeds, perhaps it is, indeed,
proper to be proud and to think well of oneself saying: "my wisdom
enabled me to acquire for myself fear of G-d and abundant moral
attainments. For such pride would seem to accord with what Jeremiah the
prophet said (Jeremiah 9:23-24): "let not the wise man glory in his
wisdom, let not the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man
glory in his riches. But let him who glories glory in this, that he
understands and knows Me." And similarly our Sages said, "everything is
in the hands of Heaven except fear of Heaven."
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
However, the triumph of a man in the spiritual realm is also vain, for
even in our service to and fear of the Blessed One our strength is too
fragile to defend us against the evil inclination, which constantly
agitates within us. As our Sages have said, "if it were not for the help
of the Holy One Blessed Be He, we could not withstand our evil
inclination." And concerning success in the study of our holy Torah,
they said, "to interpret a Talmudic discussion in accord with the
halakhah requires heavenly assistance."
</span></p>      <p><span class="c1"> 
So Jeremiah was referring only to a person who already has an
egotistical bent. If one has such a tendency, then let him glory not in
his wealth or in his worldly wisdom, but, based on the principle that
performing a good deed for an ulterior motive leads one to perform the
good deed for its own sake ("מתוך שלא לשמה בא לשמה"), let
him glory rather in his knowledge and understanding of G-d. But true
servants of G-d, knowing that their own fear of G-d and their moral
accomplishments are but the gift of G-d (as it says, "Open up for Me the
width of a needle and I will open it for you as wide as the door of a
palace"), will distance themselves from any form of pridefulness. It is
especially necessary to be conscientious about such pride when the
danger is more acute. 
</span></p>      <p><span class="c1"> 
At Sukkot-time, having just observed Rosh Hashanah
and Yom Kippur, having increased our study of Torah and our performance
of good deeds, and having just repented unto G-d with all our hearts and
all our souls, we have cleansed and purified our souls to such an extent
that we are comparable to the angels on high. And since, during the
period between Yom Kippur and Sukkot, we are completely preoccupied with
our preparations for the mitzvot of sukkah and the four species, which
is why our Sages commented on the verse "and you shall take for
yourselves on the first day [of Sukkot]" (וּלְקַחְתֶּם לָכֶם בַּיּוֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן) (Leviticus 23:40), [instead of referring to the day of the
month, as the Scripture usually does in identifying a particular date]
that the first day of Sukkot is the first day of the New Year on which
transgressions are counted. Because people are inclined to be prideful,
they may boastfully say, "I have climbed the holy steps without help or
support." However, if one fixes his gaze on the hidden meaning of the
commandment of the sukkah, one will recognize, and thank G-d, that the
Eternal has stood at his right side to enable him to gather mitzvot and
good deeds into his storehouse.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
This is what the Sifri was referring to in commenting that the verse
"חַג הַסֻּכֹּת תַּעֲשֶׂה לְךָ" teaches us that the sukkah is related to
the mundane. The Sifri meant that the sukkah teaches us a lesson about
the temporal world and our material possessions, such as the harvest of
crops. We are to be reminded that all our material accomplishments and
acquisitions were possible only with the aid of Divine Providence. That,
of course, is the well-known symbolism of the sukkah. But then the Sifri
asks: how do we know that the same is true even  לגבוה, i.e., in the
realm of the sacred? In other words, how do we know that, even in
acquiring Torah and good deeds through the fear of G-d, one may not take
pride in his accomplishments?
The Sifri answers that it is written "חַג הַסֻּכּוֹת שִׁבְעַת יָמִים לד׳" which teaches us that the symbolism of the sukkah
extends even to the spiritual realm. The sukkah teaches us to recognize
that we owe our spiritual as well as material achievements to Divine
Providence. If so, the Sifri asks, why does the Scripture write
"חַג הַסֻּכֹּת תַּעֲשֶׂה לְךָ" (make [the festival of sukkot] for yourself)? Is it not
a קל וחומר? If it is impossible to acquire the Torah and perform
good deeds without the aid of Divine Providence, how much more difficult
must it be to acquire material possessions without Divine Providence? To
this question the Sifri answers, as long as we make the sukkah, G-d
considers it to have been made for His sake. In other words, if you
understand and attribute you success in Torah and good deeds to the
Almighty, then G-d will credit you as if your accomplishments had been
achieved without Divine assistance.
This is what is meant by the verse "חַג הַסֻּכֹּת תַּעֲשֶׂה לְךָ." For
as a result of our understanding of the symbolism of the sukkah, G-d
will attribute entirely to our own credit our efforts to fulfill the
Torah and the commandments. In dwelling in the sukkah it is as if we
say: "kindness is yours, O, G-d, how great is your kindness unto us"
(וּלְךָ  ד׳ חָסֶד חַסְדְּךָ גָּדוֹל עָלָי). You reward each one of
us according to our own actions, as if we fulfilled Your commandments on
our own without help. And this is a great kindness.

In the Midrash </span> (Qohelet Rabbah 11:2)
<span class="c2"> we find: "Give a portion to
seven," </span>(Ecclesiastes 11:2) <span class="c2"> this refers to the seven days of Sukkot,
"or, even to eight" </span> (Id.)  <span class="c2"> refers to Shemini Atzeret. And the verse
concludes: "For you do not know what evil shall be upon the earth"
   </span> (Id.)</p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> 
This Midrash begs interpretation, and our master explained it with
reference to the verse (Proverbs 16:4): "The Lord has made everything
for its purpose," which means that every character trait, whether good
or bad, is required for some purpose and brings a human being to
perfection. While He has made everything for His purposes, but only in
its proper time, it is incumbent on every individual to understand and
discern under what circumstances a particular trait, or its negation, is
appropriate. For example, the very disgraceful trait of cruelty must, as
we know, be employed for the commandment of circumcision to be fulfilled.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
It can readily be seen that the seven days of Sukkot represent the trait
of true friendship and togetherness, with all being attached to one
another, great and small, the righteous and the not-so righteous. The
Torah says (Leviticus 23:42): "all that are native in Israel shall dwell
in booths." From here our Sages deduced that all Israel sit together in
one sukkah, which means that all Israel come together, without
distinction, as one. The four species, lulav, etrog, hadas, and aravah
symbolize the different classes of people at different levels, and the
Torah says (Leviticus 23:40): "you shall take for yourselves"
(וּלְקַחְתֶּם לָכֶם), i.e., a complete taking in which all four species
are taken together for a single commandment. Moreover, the multitude of
sacrifices on Sukkot represent, and arouse us to await, the designated
time about which the prophet said (Isaiah 11:6): "the wolf shall dwell
with the lamb." However much may people differ in their beliefs, their
coming together is a wonderful means by which the nation as a whole
becomes a vessel that will hold a blessing. Indeed, the Sages endeavored
to find an explicit verse that would teach this idea (Hosea 4:17):
"Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone." All these rituals come
together as one to teach us the trait of love, affection, and
friendship, to draw near the hearts that are estranged one from another
so that the tent might be one.
However, the Torah tells us that, immediately after this, on the eighth
day (Numbers 29: 35): "On the eighth day you shall have a solemn
assembly" (עֲצֶרֶת), on which day everyone puts away the four species,
and returns from the sukkah into his home, and only one bullock is
sacrificed. As Hazal interpret it in the Midrash, the Eternal asks us:
"make me a small repast." During the seven days of the festival, our joy
consisted in the unity and coming together of so many people, as if we
were saying: "do we not all have one Father Who created us all?" But
then the eighth day comes upon us suddenly with its commandment of
"עֲצֶרֶת," the meaning of which indicates loneliness and a departure
from the assembly, so that your eyes may see only your Guide. Each
individual, by himself, rejoices in the Eternal, and the people become
separated from one another by performing - each person according to his
capacity and understanding - a service that is directed towards the
Eternal alone. Socializing would defeat this purpose, and would be the
opposite of what is desired in the performance of this commandment and
this service.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
It appears clear that the commandment of "עֲצֶרֶת" involves distancing
oneself from those who are estranged, for the same reason that the Tanna
said (Avot 1:7):
keep at a distance from an evil neighbor, do not make yourself an
associate of a wicked man, and do not abandon faith in [divine] retribution.
The intent of this saying is that even if it seems to you that you will
achieve some objective by associating with a wicked person, there is
still a corresponding possibility that the association could lead to
some greater evil in the future, and that G-d will destroy your whatever
you may accomplish.
Thus, the verse (Ecclesiastes 7:14): "In the day of prosperity be
joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; G-d has made one day as
well as the other" refers to and symbolizes the seven days of the
festival during which one should be joyful. The joy in the assembly of
all the people is such that our Sages tell us that even those
individuals who are not usually careful to avoid ritual impurity are
presumed not to impart ritual impurity during the festival. During the
festival all Israel are friends. However, "on the day of adversity" 
(בְיוֹם רָעָה), consider and reflect upon the time and the occasion when
indiscriminate association and friendship may be the source of great
evil. So just as you are rewarded for coming together, so, too, will you
be rewarded from separating yourself, for "G-d has made one day as well
as the other." In other words, the Eternal commanded us to observe both
the seven days of the festival and the eighth day as well in order to
alert us to the important duty of reflecting upon both aspects of this
matter.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
It was to this that Midrash was referring when it commented that the
verse "Give a portion to seven" refers to the first seven days of Sukkot
while "or, even unto eight" refers to Shemini Atzeret, which has the
opposite significance. Since you cannot know what evil may come to pass,
so you must not disbelieve in retribution. This teaches us that for
everything, i.e., for both joining together and for separating oneself,
there is an appropriate time and place.

The Midrash (va-yikra rabbah 30:12) teaches:
Just as the Scripture includes both the אתרוג, which has both aroma and
flavor, and the ערבה, which has neither aroma nor flavor, so, too
Israel includes those who have both Torah knowledge and goods and those
who have neither Torah knowledge nor good deeds. What can the Holy One
Blessed Be He do with Israel? He cannot destroy them. Instead the Holy
Blessed Be He says: "let them come together in a single group and they
will atone one for the other."
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Just as the אתרוג has taste as well as fragrance, so Israel have among
them men who possess learning and good deeds. . . . Just as the
palm-tree has taste but not fragrance, so Israel have among them such as
possess learning but not good deeds. . . . Just as the myrtle has
fragrance but no taste, so Israel have among them such as possess good
deeds but not learning. . . . Just as the willow has no taste and no
fragrance, so Israel have among them people who possess neither learning
nor good deeds. What then does the Holy One, blessed be He, do to them?
To destroy them is impossible. But, says the Holy One, blessed be He,
let them all be tied together in one band and they will atone one for
another.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Our master explained how these words of our Sages "they will atone one
for another" can be understood. For is it not the opposite? Should not
the joining together of those without Torah knowledge or good deeds
magnify their guilt? Moreover, the words of our Sages appear to
contradict their interpretation of the verse (Song of Songs 6:7) "your
cheeks are like halves of pomegranate" to mean that even the least of
you are as full of good deeds as a pomegranate.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
However, this Midrash may be understood according to the Gemara in Hulin
7b.  R. Phineas the son of Yair said: "The people of Israel are holy. Yet
there is he who desires [to benefit others] but has not the means;
whilst another has the means but has not the desire."
The Tosaphot explain that they are called holy, because the one that has
but does not want to invite a guest does so nevertheless out of shame.
And what was once said by a holy person concerning why the saying begins
in plural (the people of Israel are holy), but ends in singular (but has
not the desire) is well known. For it is only when the people of Israel
are brought together that they are called holy, because it is only then
that the one who has the means, but not the desire, to invite a guest,
does so, out of shame, nevertheless. He does the good deed involuntarily
because of his attachment to another who wants to invite a guest but
does not have the means to do so. Because they are together, they both
are called holy. Thus, it is shame that causes the least meritorious
among the people to do good deeds. But this is possible only when they
are together, for they will do good deeds only when others are watching
them. (See our master's explanation of the verse (Deuteronomy 33:19)
"they shall call peoples to their mountains, there they offer right
sacrifices" (עַמִּים הַר יִקְרָאוּ שָׁם יִזְבְּחוּ זִבְחֵי צֶדֶק) in פרשת וְזֹאת הַבְּרָכָה.)
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Now the Midrash may be understood. By coming together, the people of
Israel atone one for another, because even those who are like the ערבה
and have neither Torah knowledge nor good deeds, will also, when they
are joined together with the others, do good deeds and even assist those
who would like to do good deeds but are unable to do so. Thus, this
Midrash corresponds exactly with what the Sages said about the verse
"your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate" that even the least among
you are as full of good deeds as a pomegranate.
