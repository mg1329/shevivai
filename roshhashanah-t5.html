	   במשנה:
	     כל השופרות כשרים חוץ
	     משל פרה מפני שהוא קרן,
	     אמר רבי יוסי, והלא כל השופרות
	     נקראו קרן שנאמר (יהושע ו, ה) בִּמְשֹׁךְ בְּקֶרֶן הַיּוֹבֵל (ראש השנה כו ע״א).

	   
      <p><span class="c2"> 
     We learn in the Mishnah that all horns
     (השופרות) except that of a cow (פרה) may be used to fulfill the
     commandment to sound the שופר on Rosh Hashanah, because the
     horn of a cow is called "קרן". R. Jose disagrees because every
     שופר is called "קרן" as it is written 
     "בִּמְשֹׁךְ בְּקֶרֶן הַיּוֹבֵל" (when they make a long blast with
     the ram's horn). 
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">      
     The objection is raised in the Gemara: R. Jose
     was surely correct in his response to the opinion of the Rabbis.
     But the position of the Rabbis is that every שופר is called
     both "קרן" and "שופר", while the horn of a cow is called only
     "קרן", but not "שופר".    </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> 
It appears that the content of this Mishnah can be explained aggadically
based on the Midrash Tanhuma on פרשת וירא.    </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
[Abraham said to G-d after the עקידה] "I had an answer in my heart
with which I could have answered You: 'Yesterday You told me (Genesis
21:12) for through Isaac shall your descendants be named' 
(כִּי בְיִצְחָק יִקָּרֵא לְךָ זָרַע) and now You say to me (Genesis 22:2) 'bring him up
there for a burnt offering' (וְהַעֲלֵהוּ שָׁם, לְעֹלָה)? But I overcame
my evil inclination and I did not answer You. Just so, when the children
of Isaac will transgress and enter into difficulty, may the עקידה be
remembered for their sake, and may it be considered before You as if his
ashes were piled on top of the altar, and may You forgive them and save
them from their trouble.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
The Holy One Blessed Be He answered him: "You said your piece. Now I
will say mine. The children of Isaac will sin before me in the future,
and I will judge them on Rosh Hashanah. But if they ask me to seek some
merit in their behalf and remember the  of Isaac, let them sound
the שופר of this before me."
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Abrraham asked: "And what is a שופר?"
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
He said to him: "Look behind you."
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Immediately (Genesis 22:13) "Abraham lifted up his eyes and he saw, and
behold a ram was caught in a thistle by his horns."
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
And our master explained this discussion by first considering the verse
"And he saw, and behold a ram," which is a great wonder. For the whole
purpose of an animal sacrifice is that the one bringing the sacrifice,
by offering the life of the animal in place of his own, should be
inspired to repent. What purpose could have been served by offering the
ram in place of Isaac? Abraham our father and his son had just been
ready and willing with all their souls to perform the aqeidah,
displaying in the fullest measure that holy feeling that can be achieved
by a person only by offering a sacrifice. And, if we reflect, it would
seem that through the aqeidah Abraham our father, purified and perfected
the essence of his character and ingrained in his descendants till the
end of time, to the degree that it became their inborn nature, to stand
like a pillar of iron against those who would push them away from the
belief in G-d. Thus, even the weak-minded among our people have not
ceased to sacrifice their lives or to be burnt in the fire. Even women
and children stretched out their necks for the sanctification of G-d's
name rather than renounce their faith. The aptitude for this holy
feeling has been passed down from generation to generation, and its
source is the עקידה.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
However, the essential test of the עקידה was not the act of the
עקידה itself, because Abraham our father had already been thrown into
a fiery furnace, and the Torah did not even bother to tell of the
greatness of his holiness in this incident. Rather, the wonder of his
holiness and righteousness is shown by his not questioning the traits of
the Blessed One even though he had grounds for questioning them and,
indeed, for raising a mighty, truly unanswerable, contradiction. And
this is an amazing level of trust that cannot be implanted in the soul
of a person except by the effort of performing very many good deeds and
by staying free of any stain and blemish, as indeed, Abraham our father
really was. Although each and every child of Israel is obligated not to
have any doubt that he would withstand the test of sacrificing his life
in a time of need, one's principal effort must be to sanctify himself
each day of his life through his reverent service to G-d.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Now the discussion can be properly understood. For Abraham wanted the
Holy One Blessed Be He to forgive the coming generations because of
their trait that stems from the act of the עקידה, their willingness to
sacrifice their lives. And so the Eternal answered him, "if they want me
to find a merit in their behalf let them sound the שופר of this before
me." Abraham our father was astonished. "What is the שופר?" What is
more elevated, and what merit is there that could be greater than the
trait of willingness to sacrifice one's own life? [Translator's note: In
other words, what is the significance of a mere ram's horn compared to
Abraham's willingness, which he had just demonstrated, to sacrifice
Isaac on G-d's command?] The Holy One Blessed Be He answered him, "Look
behind you." By which He meant, "look at your constant good deeds from
your infancy until today, by which you perfected yourself to become
exactly like a sacrifice." And then he saw, and behold a ram, just like
a sacrifice, free from any blemish, in the category of 
"הַקְרִיבֵהוּ נָא לְפֶחָתֶךָ." It is only such a creature that is fit to be brought to
the altar.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
According to this, one can say that the word "קרן" refers to the being
in itself and its power to perform action. This power appears to be the
power ingrained in the heart of every child of Israel to sacrifice his
life to sanctify the name of G-d. However, the word "שופר" refers to
the constant good deeds, as if to say "beautify your deeds" 
(שפרו מעשיכם). A child of Israel must therefore seek to achieve both.
And that is why the Rabbis say in the Mishnah with which we started (in
accord with whom the halakha is decided) that we need both, קרן and
שופר. And in this merit, may the transgressions of Israel be forgiven.

The B'nai Yisaskhar, in commenting on "יום תרועה," quotes the following
passage from the Jerusalem Talmud:
</span></p>
</div>
    <div style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right:
      50px;">
      <p><span class="c2"> 
R. Siman said it is written (Deuteronomy 4:8): "And what other great
nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that I am
setting before you today?" R. Hiya and R. Oshaia explained, this means
what nation is like this nation? In the normal course of events, a man
who has a court case, wears black and covers himself in a black cloak
and grows a beard, because he does not know how the case will be
decided. But Israel is not like this, they wear white, and they eat and
they drink and they rejoice, for they know that the Holy One Blessed Be
He performs miracles for them.
</span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> 
The B'nai Yisaskhar writes that the commentators on the Jerusalem Talmud
were unable to explain how the verse and the derivation taken from the
verse are connected. They therefore suggest altering the text and
associating the derivation with the preceding verse: "For what great
nation is there that has G-d so near to them." But the B'nai Yisaskhar
upholds the text of the Jerusalem Talmud as is. And our master as well
took his part in explaining the Jerusalem Talmud according to the extant
text in a precious and exalted manner.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
The Sages say in the Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 26a): "all kinds of שופר
may be used except that of a cow, because it is called קרן." R. Jose
says: "are not all שופרות called 'קרן,' as it is written (Joshua
6:5): "when they make a long blast with a ram's horn (קרן)?" And the
Gemara explains that the Rabbis hold that all שופרות are called both
"שופר" and "קרן," but the horn of a cow is called only "קרן," but
not "שופר."
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
This can be explained metaphorically inasmuch as the שופר represents
the idea of repentance and calls on us all and arouses us to repent. As
the holy Shalah expounds at length, the sound of the teqiah is a plain
sound signifying a person before he transgresses and before there is any
crookedness or perversion (Deuteronomy 32:4) within him. The short
sounds of teruah recall crying, and the broken sounds of shevarim recall
sighing, signifying the transgression that breaks a person and compels
him to hang his head. The final teqiah signifies repentance which
returns the individual to the Eternal and guides the direction of his
feet and straightens that which was crooked.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
However, people do not all return on the same path. There are those who
repent from their wickedness because they fear that the Eternal will
take retribution and will repay their wickedness in kind. This is the
lower repentance. And though one who repents in this way emerges free
from the stain of his transgression just as he was before he sinned, he
has gained nothing by his repentance for the Eternal does not consider
his transgressions as if they were meritorious deeds. But it is not so
for the precious individual who returns to the Eternal with all his
heart, whose soul proclaims "the Eternal is my portion" to love Him and
to cling to Him. That is repentance from love and is the higher
repentance. For the transgressions of one such as this become a hallowed
fruit, inasmuch as his offenses are now considered as meritorious.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
According to this, we may understand why the שופר has two names,
"שופר" and "קרן." For in the language of the Talmud, a thing in
itself (i.e., principal) is referred to as "קרן" as in "קרן וחומש" 
(the principal plus a fifth). See the Tosaphot Yom Tov at the
beginning of the tractate of Pei'ah and the Ramban on the verse 
"בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה" who both say that the core and the being of something is
called "קרן." This is what is signified by the sound of a "קרן"
representing repentance out of fear. For if one repents out of fear,
then his being is restored to its completeness as it was before the
transgression. However, in the Talmud, the Sages understood the word
"שופר" to suggest that we beautify our actions (שפרו מעשיכם).
In other words, if one repents out of love one's guilt is beautified and
is transformed into a meritorious act (just as they understood the name
of the midwife Shifra in Exodus to signify one who beautified the
newborn child).
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
This is why the Sages and R. Jose disagreed. In the view of the Sages
only that which is called both "שופר" and "קרן"- signifying both
types of repentance, from fear and from love - is valid. However, in the
opinion of R. Jose even that which is called only "קרן" is also valid,
because it would suffice if they repented from fear and trepidation. And
would that we did repent.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
In Rosh Hashanah 32b, R. Jose and R. Judah disagreed about whether a
verse in which only the word "teru'ah" is mentioned may be recited as
part of the "שופרות" section of the amidah on Rosh Hashanah. R. Yossi
says that it may be recited as part of the "שופרות" section and R.
Judah says that one does not fulfill his obligation by reciting such a
verse. According to what we have said above, each opinion follows from
one of the two general approaches that we have discussed. For a verse in
which only the word "תרועה," but not "שופר," appears would suggest
that a "קרן" would be valid for it is sufficient if one repents from
fear. That is why, according to the Sages who disagree with R. Jose, one
may not recite such a verse as part of the "שופרות." But according to
R. Jose, one may recite such a verse, because he holds that even the
horn of a cow, which is called "קרן" but not "שופר," would be valid.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
We may in this manner explain the verse (Psalms 81:3-4) "blow the horn
at the new moon, at the fool moon, on our festal day. For it is a
statute for Israel, an ordinance of the G-d of Jacob" (תִּקְעוּ בַחֹדֶשׁ
שׁוֹפָר בַּכֵּסֶה לְיוֹם חַגֵּנוּ. כִּי חֹק לְיִשְׂרָאֵל הוּא מִשְׁפָּט לֵאלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב). 
In other words the Torah hid the name and did not explicitly
say either "שופר" or "קרן," so that we should understand the two
types of repentance that are represented by the שופר that is blown on
this day. And the words "a statute for Israel" represent those who stand
on a higher level (i.e., Israel the more distinguished name). They will
repent out of love and will return to the Eternal with all their hearts.
All their offenses will therefore be transformed into meritorious acts,
which is a statute (חק) which is inexplicable, inasmuch as it does not
conform to the ways of justice as it is beyond the understanding of
mortals how a sinner may be rewarded by not only being forgiven for his
sins, but even being rewarded for them. However, the words "an ordinance
for the G-d of Jacob" represent those who stand at a lower level who are
therefore designated by the less distinguished name, Jacob. These
individuals repent only out of fear that the Eternal will repay their
bad deeds in kind. To them G-d acts justly and forgives their
transgressions, because He is a G-d of justice (אלקי משפט). On Rosh
Hashanah, therefore, the Eternal performs a statute for Israel and an
ordinance for Jacob (חֹק לְיִשְׂרָאֵל הוּא מִשְׁפָּט לֵאלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב).
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Now we can understand the passage in the Jerusalem Talmud from which we
started.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
R. Siman said it is written (Deuteronomy 4:8): "And what other great
nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that I am
setting before you today?" R. Hiya and R. Oshaia explained: this means
what nation is like this nation? In the normal course of events, a man
who has a court case, wears black and covers himself in a black cloak
and grows a beard, because he does not know how the case will be
decided. But Israel is not like this. They wear white, and they eat and
they drink and they rejoice, for they know that the Holy One Blessed Be
He performs miracles for them.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
It is written in the holy Zohar that "today" in this verse refers to
Rosh Hashanah and that the discussion in the Jerusalem Talmud was also
in relation to Rosh Hashanah. And in quoting the verse "what other great
nation has ordinances and statutes as just as this entire law that I am
setting before you today," the Jerusalem Talmud is referring on the one
hand to those who repent out of love, for it is a statute (i.e.,
rationally inexplicable) that the Eternal should transform
transgressions into meritorious acts and on the other hand to those who
repent out of fear whom the Eternal treats justly by forgiving them.
"That I am setting before you this day" refers to Rosh Hashanah, and
that is why they wear white, festive, clothes and they eat and drink
delicacies and sweets and rejoice, for the love of the Eternal is their
salvation. For not only does He forgive their sins, but he considers
their offenses to be meritorious acts and good deeds. That is why the
passage concludes, "for they know that the Holy One Blessed Be He
performs miracles for them." In other words, just as a miracle is beyond
comprehension, so too is the statute (חק) by which our transgressions
are transformed into good deeds hidden from us.
