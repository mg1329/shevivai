          In the Midrash (Leviticus Rabbah 20:1) it is written:
          R. Simeon opened his discourse with the text (Ecclesiastes
          9:2) "All
          things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous
          and to the
          wicked" (הכל כאשר לכל מקרה אחד לצדיק ולרשע וכו'). . . .
          "There is one event to the righteous," applies to the sons of
          Aaron, of
          whom it is written (Malachi 2:6) "He walked with Me in peace
          and
          uprightness" (בשלום ובמישור) and "To the wicked"
          applies to the company of Korah, in regard to whom it is
          written
          (Numbers 16:26), "Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these
          wicked
          men" (סורו נא מעל אהלי האנשים הרשעים האלה). The latter
          entered the Tabernacle to offer in a spirit of contentiousness
          and ended
          by being burnt, while the former entered to offer without
          contentiousness, and ended by being burnt. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          And our master explained that R. Simeon wished to explain the
          words of
          Ecclesiastes, for G-d forbid that he would have meant that the
          identical
          punishment comes equally to all, and the righteous and the
          wicked are
          treated alike. Rather, he meant to say that at times a
          righteous person
          is judged, in order to teach a lesson to the onlookers, by an
          exacting
          standard for a small transgression just as a wicked person
          would be
          judged for a severe transgression. And R. Simeon inferred that
          this is
          so from our verse which says "when they drew near to the
          Eternal, and
          they died" (בקרבתם לפני ה' וימותו). But is this
          correct? For was it not, in fact, because they brought forward
          a strange
          fire, not because they drew near, that they died? </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          In the Sifra it is written:
          R. Jose the Galilean said that they died because they came
          near and not
          because they brought forward a strange fire, and R. Akiva said
          that they
          died because they brought forward a strange fire and not
          because they
          came near. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          Now R. Simeon also follows the opinion of his teacher, R.
          Akiva, that
          they died because they brought forward a strange fire. But in
          that case,
          why does the Scripture say "when they drew near" (בקרבתם)? R.
          Simeon
          therefore explains that their transgression of bringing
          forward a
          strange fire was not a capital offense for which they deserved
          to be
          killed.. It was only because of the stature of these two
          princes of
          Israel that their overstepping the bounds was considered a
          sin, because
          the Eternal will be made holy among those who are close to
          Him. Thus,
          the words "when they drew near to the Eternal" (בקרבתם לפני
          ה') mean that it was because they were (already) close to the
          Eternal and very precious in His sight that they died. And
          this is why
          Ecclesiastes took up his discourse and said, "one fate comes
          to the
          righteous and the wicked," because a righteous person is
          punished with
          fury for a small, trifling offense as is a wicked person for
          his great evil.

          איש איש מבית ישראל אשר ישחט וכו' ונכרת האיש ההוא וכו' ולא

        sacrifices to

    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
          One may ask the following questions about this verse:
          <br>
          1. Why is it written "from the house of Israel" (מבית ישראל)
          after
          the Scripture has already written "you shall speak to all the
          children
          of Israel" (בני ישראל)?
          <br>
          2. Why should a person be "cut off" because he slaughtered
          outside the
          Tabernacle and did not bring the animal to the door of the
          tent of
          meeting (פתח אוהל מועד)? For he did not, in fact, offer the
          animal
          as an idolatrous sacrifice
          <br>
          3. How does the Ramban (Nahmanides) explain the verse that
          explicitly
          says "so they shall no more slay their sacrifices for satyrs
          (ולא יזבחו עוד את זבחיהם לשעירים) which shows clearly that, as
          the Rambam
          (Maimonides) wrote, the Eternal only commanded our ancestors
          to bring
          sacrifices so that they should no longer offer sacrifices to
          the satyrs
          in the abominable fashion manner of the other nations? For the
          Rambam
          explained that the Eternal wished to lead the nation away from
          the
          despised service of sacrifices to false deities and
          substituted in its
          place the sacrificial service to the Eternal. And the Ramban,
          protesting
          loudly, poured scorn on these words of the Rambam. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          However, our master says that it would appear that the chapter
          that
          prohibits slaughtering an animal outside the Tabernacle
          follows the
          chapter prescribing the service of the Day of Atonement just
          because the
          service of the Day of Atonement contained something new and
          strange,
          namely sending the scapegoat to עזאזל to be put to death in
          the desert,
          without its having come inside the Sanctuary, by the hand of a
          man in
          readiness (איש ע</span><span class="c1">ת</span><span
          class="c1">י</span><span class="c1">). And we have no priest
          in his service, nor a Levite
          on his platform. What is this service unto us (מה העבודה הזאת
          לנו)? </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          The commentators have already discussed this service, and have
          expounded
          at length in seeking to clarify it. The upshot of their
          discussions is
          that we offer the scapegoat as a propitiation of the עזאזל</span><span
          class="c1">)</span><span class="c1"> סיטרא דמסאבא), so that he
          will take his portion and not seek to rip us
          asunder. And although we certainly have nothing to do with
          mysteries
          (אין לנו חלק בנסתרות), we may deduce from that portion which
          is in
          our hands [i.e., the revealed Torah] that the Torah has warned
          us that
          we may not infer, G-d forbid, from the service of the
          scapegoat that it
          would be permissible to offer a sacrifice to the satyrs on the
          altar.
          One might have reached this conclusion by arguing that the
          commandment
          to bring sacrifices only in the Tent of Assembly was
          restricted to the
          priests who are dedicated to the Eternal for they offer up His
          bread on
          the altar. It is, one might have supposed, only the priests
          who may not
          perform any service outside the Tabernacle. However, any
          ordinary
          Israelite (איש איש מבני ישראל) might, according to this
          reasoning,
          be permitted to bring a sacrifice to whomever his heart
          desired, just as
          the "man in readiness" (איש עת) does with the scapegoat. It
          was against
          such an argument that the Scripture is giving a warning,
          because the
          guilt of one who offers such a sacrifice is too great to bear
          and he
          would be cut off from Israel. The Scripture then continues "so
          they
          shall no more slay their sacrifices for satyrs," which means
          that they
          should not perform any other practice like the service of the
          scapegoat,
          because G-d prescribed that this service be performed only on
          the Day of
          Atonement, and it is a secret hidden from us. And secrets are
          only for
          the Eternal (והנסתרות לה'). The subsequent words:
          "after whom they play the harlot" (אשר הם זונים אחריהם) is a
          reference to the satyrs, the demons, and the spirits that, as
          the Ramban
          wrote, desire these sacrifices.
