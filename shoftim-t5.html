Rashi comments:
appoint judges who are expert and righteous to render righteous judgment
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Rashi meant by this that Moses, here, was not commanding the judges to
render righteous judgment but rather was commanding those who would
select the judges to choose righteous and upright judges who could be
expected to judge righteously. And his comment was appropriate, because
immediately afterwards Moses says to the judges, "you shall not pervert
justice, you shall not show partiality, and you shall not take a bribe"
(לֹא תַטֶּה מִשְׁפָּט לֹא תַכִּיר פָּנִים וְלֹא תִקַּח שֹׁחַד). However, the
question arises: Why did Moses not discuss the judges or their
qualifications at all? He should have said: "appoint for yourselves
righteous and upright judges." Then, after their qualifications had been
enumerated, it would have been appropriate to add "and they will render
just judgment." Why did he leave this implicit rather than state it
explicitly?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
But it appeared to our master to explain that precisely by saying that
they should appoint judges and officers, Moses was assuring them that
the judges would render just judgment, because, in saying "appoint
judges" he meant to say "but not a king." The topic of a king is only
mentioned later when Moses says (Deuteronomy 17:14) "And you will say 'I
set a king over me like all the nations round about me,'" which shows
[because "and you will say" shows that the idea for a king comes from
the people not from G-d, as in fact was the case at the time of Samuel]
that the Eternal did not want this. Samuel the Ramati also responded
bitterly when they said to him "Give us a king," because a king would
not care about the will of the people and his heart would have no
concern for them, but would just do as he pleased. And who would say to
the king: "what are you doing?" Nor must a king follow the laws and
statutes that govern the state. Rather he issues decrees right and left
as his heart desires. Not so are the judges and officers appointed by
the citizens of the state! For they do not rule forever, and their reign
is not perpetual, but lasts only as long as the people wish them to
rule. Nor do their children inherit their positions, as does the son of
the king who succeeds his father and is coronated with or without the
consent of the people. Judges are therefore obliged to render just and
upright judgments according to the laws of the state. And that is why a
judge and an officer are preferred by the Eternal to a king, a monarch,
and a sovereign, and why Moses said "You shall appoint judges and
officers," but not a king. In doing so, you can be certain that they
will judge the nation justly, and that, unlike a king, they will not do
what their hearts desire without protest.

When you come to the
land . . . and shall say, I will set a king over me . . . . You shall
set him king over you, whom the Lord your G-d shall choose; one from
among your brothers shall you set king over you; you may not set a
stranger over you
</span> (Deuteronomy 17:14-15)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
See the Ramban who was at pains to explain why Moses admonishes "you may
not put a foreigner over you" after saying that the Eternal will Himself
choose the king. If so, the decision about who shall be king is in the
hand of G-d, and He will not choose a foreigner.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And it appeared to our master to explain that there was never a definite
commandment from the Eternal to choose a king. It was only if the people
would demand a king and would say "I would put a king over me" that they
were permitted to institute a monarchy. And the reason that the Eternal
did not choose a king, but only judges and officers, is that, as we
wrote above, a judge stands under the rule of the people who chose him
and by virtue of whose authority he became the head. It is therefore
incumbent upon him to uphold righteousness and justice. However, a king
chosen by the Eternal is elevated above the entire people whom he
commands. And if so, he inevitably stands above the laws that are
written in the Torah and he need not decide in accordance with those
laws, but may decide according to his own discretion. For the king may
break through fences and no one may resist him.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
So should the people become unruly and depart from a moral path and
should the judges, because they govern according to the precepts of the
Torah and justice and righteousness, lack the power to restrain the
people who will not be disciplined by these precepts, then it becomes
imperative for them to install a king who, breaking any upraised arm,
will impose law and order upon them and discipline them brutally for
their transgressions. As the one chosen by the Eternal to stand in the
breach, his fear and his awe will be upon them, for he will show no pity
in meting out punishment and will do with them as he sees fit. Indeed,
his authority over the people will be upheld only if they believe that
the king, having been chosen by G-d to reign over them, need not conduct
himself with them according to the Torah, whose ways are the ways of
pleasantness. For his selection by G-d has raised him above them so that
he may do whatever he likes with them. As a result, the people will be
too intimidated to disobey the king, because he has the authority to
punish them with cruelty and fury. This is the meaning of "you shall set
over you him whom the Lord your G-d will choose" 
(שׂוֹם תָּשִׂים עָלֶיךָ מֶלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר ה"א בּוֹ) from which the Sages deduced:
Let fear of him be upon you. And how should it be upon you? Through your
belief that the Lord your G-d has chosen him
(שתהא אימתו עליך, ובמה שתאמין אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר ה"א בּוֹ).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is in contrast to the judges about whom it says "you shall appoint
for yourself" (תִּתֶּן לְךָ), because they are selected by the people
while the king is chosen by G-d by way of a prophet or the Urim and
Thummim. Therefore "שׂוֹם תָּשִׂים" means that the fear of him should be upon
you owing to your knowledge that the Eternal has chosen him, so that his
power and his authority come from G-d and not from you.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Moses then goes on to warn them not to say that we will not ask G-d and
His prophets to choose a king, but instead we will choose a king from
another nation of whom, because he is a foreigner (אִישׁ נָכְרִי), we will
be very fearful, who will administer punishment without pity. If we
appoint a foreign king to discipline us, why do we need a king whom the
Eternal will choose? Concerning such an idea, Moses says: "you may not
do so, for one from among your brothers you shall set as king."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Afterwards, Moses gives a warning to the king and says (Deuteronomy
17:18): "and when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom," i.e., when,
after having eliminated all the evil-doers from the land, his throne is
stabilized and his reign secure, then he too should conduct himself
uprightly to do justice and righteousness and "he shall write for
himself in a book a copy of this law." And from that time, he should see
what is written in the Torah and act accordingly "and he may not turn
aside from the commandment either to the right or the left." For after
he has smitten the wicked with the rod of his mouth and restored peace
to his realm, he will no longer be obliged to act beyond the limits of
the law  (להוראת שעה).

You shall be blameless before the Lord your G-d

Rashi comments:
walk before Him wholeheartedly, put your hope in Him and do not attempt
to investigate the future, but whatever it may be that comes upon you
accept it wholeheartedly, and then you shall be with Him and become His
portion
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Ramban, however, explains that we should direct our hearts toward
Him alone and we should seek after the future from His prophets, those
who are beloved by Him, and from the Urim and Thummim. It seems that he
inferred this from the verses below (Deuteronomy 18:15): "The Lord your
G-d will raise up for you, a prophet like me from among you, from your
brethren - to him shall you listen." This seems to suggest that we may
seek after the future and ask what will happen to us, but may do so only
from a prophet. However, Rashi interpreted this verse differently and
understands "you shall be blameless" (תָּמִים תִּהְ') to mean that you
shall not attempt to search the future at all. Only then can one be
"blameless" with the Eternal.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Although the verses below (Deuteronomy 18:14-15):
 "כִּי הַגּוֹיִם הָאֵלֶּה וכו' אֶל מְעֹנְנִים וְאֶל קֹסְמִים יִשְׁמָעוּ וְאַתָּה וכו' נָבִיא מִקִּרְבְּךָ
מֵאַחֶיךָ כָּמֹנִי יָקִים לְךָ וכו'"
For these nations, which you shall possess, listened to soothsayers, and
to diviners; but as for you, the Lord your G-d has not allowed you so to
do. The Lord your G-d will raise to you a prophet from your midst, from
your brothers, like me; to him you shall listen.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This verse contrasts the "soothsayers and diviners," who may not be consulted,
with a prophet of G-d, who shall be heeded, as this
prophet speaks in the name of the Eternal concerning one of the
commandments. Thus, even if a prophet should, under some extraordinary
circumstance (הוראת שעה), command you to act contrary to the law,
as Elijah did at Mount Carmel, you must listen to him. And by saying
that these nations give heed to soothsayers and to diviners, Moses meant
that even though these nations have soothsayers and diviners who claim
to be able to foretell the future, no knowledge of the future is brought
to them except through their machinations of secret arts, magic and
sorcery. Only then can they grasp, as did the magicians of Egypt and
their ilk, some fragment of the future. However, we, the children of the
living G-d, must have nothing to do with this. Rather, the Eternal will
communicate to His prophets and they will tell us what we must know. But
we may not search after the future. Thus, Moses said: "From this fact
you can understand that the Eternal does not want you to search after
the future. While the nations have soothsayers and diviners who perform
their various machinations to grasp some fragment of the future, to you
the Eternal has given prophets who will prophesy in His name when He
confers His spirit upon them at the time of His desiring. But He has not
empowered those prophets to perform any action by which they can bring
prophecy down upon themselves. You therefore must be blameless with the
Lord your G-d and listen only to the prophet who will speak to you in
the name of the Eternal."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And the words of Rashi appear more reasonable than those of the Ramban,
because it is written below (Deuteronomy 18:16-19):
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
"כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר שָׁאַלְתָּ מֵעִם ה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ בְּחֹרֵב וכו', נָבִיא אָקִים לָהֶם וכו', וְנָתַתִּי דְבָרַי
בְּפִיו וכו', וְהָיָה הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר לֹא יִשְׁמַע"
Just as you desired of the Lord your G-d at Horeb on the day of the
assembly, when you said: 'Let me not hear the voice of the Lord my G-d,
or see this great fire any more, lest I die' . . . I will raise them up
for them a prophet like you from among their brethren; and I will put My
words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command
them. And whoever will give heed unto My words which he shall speak in
my name, I will require it of him.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
From here it appears that the Scripture is speaking about a prophet of
the law who is giving prophecy in the name of the Eternal that they
should do this or do that, but not about a prophet who will reveal that
which is hidden. For (Deuteronomy 29:29) "the secret things belong to
the Lord our G-d; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to
our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law." This
means that whatever is revealed to us from the secret things is revealed
only so that we may do our duty, and to warn the people what will befall
them should they not take heed to fulfill the Torah.
