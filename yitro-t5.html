Rashi comments:
If you will not come out for my own sake, come out for the sake of your
wife; if you will not come out for your wife's sake, come out for the
sake of your two sons.

See the Siphtei Hakhamim whose explanation is not clear. But it appears
to our master to say simply that the children of the righteous are
dearer to them than their wives, as was the case with Jacob who placed
his wives in front of his children before meeting Esau. However,
everyone, including the righteous, certainly loves his wife more than he
loves his father-in-law. So why did Jethro place himself before Moses's
wife and Moses's sons? Should he not have said "behold, your sons, and
your wife, and I, your father-in-law, are coming to you." That is why
Rashi had to explain that Jethro's message to Moses was not to inform
him of the happy news that they were coming to him. For if that were the
reason, he would not have placed himself before his wife and sons.
Rather, Jethro wanted Moses, himself, to come out to receive them. He
therefore said come out to greet us for my sake. And if not for my sake,
come out for your wife's sake, who is more important to you than am I.
And if not for her sake, come out for the sake of her sons, who are the
most beloved of all.

Rashi comments:
And where had Moses gone? Was it not he who had gone out to meet Jethro
and had been the cause of all the honor shown to him? But [the
explanation of why he is not mentioned as having come to eat bread with
Jethro is] that he was standing by and waiting upon them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Then on the words "לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹקִים" Rashi comments:
From here we deduce that one who takes part in ("נהנה" - has
enjoyment from) a meal at which scholars sit [i.e. אֱלֹקִים = מֹשֶׁה] may
be regarded as if he has enjoyment from the splendor of the שכינה
(Berakhot 64a).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
These two deductions are contradictory, so that to uphold one is to
undermine the other. For if we say that Moshe was standing by and
waiting upon them then we cannot say that "לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹקִים" means "before
מֹשֶׁה" (as the Gemara in Berakhot 64a cited by Rashi interprets it) and
therefore that everyone who takes part in a meal in which scholars sit
(i.e. מֹשֶׁה) may be regarded as if he has enjoyment from the splendor of
the Shehinah. On the other hand, if we say that "לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹקִים" means
"before Moses" then there is no question about where Moses had gone. It
is therefore a wonder that Rashi did not write his comment on "לִפְנֵי
הָאֱלֹקִים" (derived from Berakhot 64a) as an alternative explanation
(דבר אחר) on the passage "ויבא אהרן". And this requires further
reflection.

Six days shall you
labor, and do all your work 
</span>(Exodus 20:9) 
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Rashi comments:
When the Sabbath comes it should be in your eyes as though all your work
were done (completed), so that you should not think at all about work.
And the Mekhilta adds: "Another interpretation: rest from thinking about
work."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
These two explanations are offered to answer the question why the
Scripture had to include an explicit commandment to work on the other
six days of the week (שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים תַּעֲבֹד) which is then reinforced
by another commandment to "do all your work" (וְעָשִׂיתָ כָּל מְלַאכְתֶּךָ).
Rashi therefore interprets the commandment to be referring to the
Sabbath, to say that when the Sabbath comes, even if all your work has
not been done, it should seem to you as if your work had been completed.
But we still must explain the beginning of the verse: "six days shall
you labor." The Mekhilta therefore offers another interpretation which
understands the verse as coming to prohibit even thinking about work on
the Sabbath. Thus, the verse is warning us to do our work diligently in
order to finish it during the six days of the work week so that there
will be no need to think about our work on the Sabbath. The two
explanations are actually complementary and may be understood as
follows: "Six days shall you labor" commands us to do our work with
energy in order to finish it entirely before the Sabbath. But should it
happen that you are unable to finish it, then we are commanded to "do
all your work." Let it seem to you as if all your work were done, so
that you will not think about your work on the Sabbath.
