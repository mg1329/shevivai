Rashi comments:
Why does the chapter of the menorah follow the chapter of the princes?
Because when Aaron saw how the princes participated in the dedication of
the Tabernacle he was disturbed that neither he nor his tribe was with
them at the dedication. The Holy One Blessed Be He therefore said to
him, "By your life, your position is greater than theirs, because you
will kindle and care for the lamps of the menorah."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
This is very amazing. Who prevented Aaron from participating in the
dedication of the altar? Didn't the princes bring their offerings purely
out of the goodness of their hearts, and not because they were commanded
to do so by the Eternal? Nor did Moses know that the Eternal would
accept the offerings of the princes until He told Moses that he would
accept them. So if Aaron's heart did not move him to bring an offering
of his own, was it appropriate for him to be upset with the Eternal? And
why then was the Eternal so quick to assuage Aaron's feelings by telling
him that he would light the lamps of the menorah? Moreover, what is so
special about this particular task that He could say to Aaron "your
position is greater than theirs"? See the commentary of the Ramban on this.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
But it appears to our master to explain that when a king honors his
subjects by coming to visit and meeting with them in one of their towns,
it is customary for the townspeople, for their part, to bring him some
gift of respect and to receive him in a festive ceremony. Moreover, the
subjects also give honor to the ministers and officers out of respect to
the king. This is what the princes of Israel did of their own accord by
bringing offerings that they themselves had donated in order to honor
the of Israel Who placed His Sanctuary in their midst (in the same
manner as the Midrash Rabbah describes at the beginning of poroshat
Emor). It is not, however, appropriate for the ministers and officers of
the king who serve him at all times to bring him an offering at the
moment when they come with him to visit his subjects. Aaron and his
tribe could not, therefore, join with the princes, the representatives
of the entire people, in bringing offerings to the Eternal. For Aaron
and the Levites were chosen by the Eternal to stand before Him to serve
Him, and, in performing their duties in the Sanctuary, they are
considered the agents of the Merciful One. Aaron thus became envious of
the princes, the leaders of the Children of Israel, because they were
given the opportunity to give honor to the most honored King, while he,
just because he was a priest of G-d Most High, could bring Him nothing.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
The Eternal cured his disappointment and gave him the commandment to
light the menorah. And this corresponds to the end of the parable found
in the Midrash Rabbah to poroshat Emor, for when the visiting king
gratefully sees the honor with which his subjects have received him, he
reciprocates and, as befits a king, bestows his own gifts upon them. Now
it is the minister of the king, the one in charge of his household who
is responsible for informing the people that the king wishes to honor
them in return. This is what the Eternal did through Aaron when he lit
the lamps of the Menorah. He showed the people that the Eternal would
shine His countenance upon them for their good. As it is written in the
Midrash Rabbah, "does the Eternal require the light of the menorah?
Rather the menorah is lit to make it known that the Divine Presence
dwells within Israel." For when the Eternal is angered to uproot a man
from the land, He hides his face from him, as it is written (Deuteronomy
31:18): "And I will surely hide my face from them," for the light of His
countenance bestows life, favor, and kindness. When, however, He lifts
up His countenance to them, it shows that He seeks their peace and their
well-being.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
This is the meaning of what the Eternal said to Aaron "your position is
greater than theirs," because Aaron is the one who goes before the
Eternal with a pillar of fire to inform the people of all the good that
the Eternal has promised to do for them and to tell the Children of
Israel that G-d is gracious unto them and they will enjoy all the
goodness of the earth.</span></p>

And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of
a man; Why are we kept back, so that we may not offer an offering to the
Lord in his appointed season among the people of Israel? </span>(Numbers 9:7)
</p>    </div><div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="c1">
See Rashi and the Sifri who say that the ritually unclean ones were
asking only to have blood sprinkled upon them by the priests. And they
interpret the verse in this way, because otherwise why would they have
asked such a question ("why should we be held back" (לָמָּה נִגָּרַע)) from
our G-d?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
But to our master the matter appears simple, since in the chapter
concerning the bringing of the Pascal offering on the fourteenth of
Nissan the Scripture writes (Numbers 9:3): "you shall keep it in its
appointed season" (תַּעֲשׂוּ אֹתוֹבְּמֹעֲדוֹ), from which the Sages deduce
that the Pascal offering is brought even on the Sabbath and even if the
people are ritually unclean. Now Moses and the elders of Israel already
knew this chapter before they were taught the law of Pesah Sheini, but
they did not yet know the difference between the ritual uncleanliness of
the entire congregation (ציבור) and of a single individual (יחיד). And
it was this point that the ritually unclean men were disputing with
Moses, and they asked: "why should we be too few so as not to bring the
offering of the Lord in its appointed season among the children of
Israel" (לָמָּה נִגָּרַע לְבִלְתִּי הַקְרִיב אֶת-קָרְבַּן יְהוָה בְּמֹעֲדוֹ בְּתוֹךְ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל)? 
For the reason that the Scripture wrote "בְּמֹעֲדוֹ" was
to teach us that the Pascal offering is brought when the congregation is
ritually unclean, and if so why should we be considered too few to bring
the Pascal offering? And Moses did not yet comprehend the matter fully,
so he said to them (Numbers 9:8): "Wait, and I will hear what the Lord
will command concerning you." Be accurate and find truth, how charming.

      <p><span class="c2">And the man Moses was very humble, more than any other men which were upon the
face of the earth.</span>(Numbers 12:3)</p>
    </div><div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Now in poroshat Noah it is written (Genesis 7:1): "for you have I seen
righteous before Me" (כִּי אֹתְךָ רָאִיתִי צַדִּיק לְפָנַי), and Rashi commented
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
It does not say here "perfectly righteous" (צַדִּיק תָּמִים) as it does at
the beginning of the poroshah; hence we infer that only a part of a
person's good qualities are enumerated in his presence, but that in his
absence all of his good qualities may be told.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
Now here concerning Moses, who wrote the entire Torah, was this praise
not told entirely in his presence? And our master said that perhaps this
is why the word "עָנָו" (humble) is written without the letter <b>י</b> so
that it might be equally understood (if the missing <b>י</b> were placed
after, instead of before, the <b>ו</b>) as <b>ענוי</b> (afflicted), because Moses
our teacher, may peace be upon him, was the most afflicted of men, for
everyone sought to find fault with him. Even his own sister, Miriam,
spoke against him, which obviously is a great affliction.
</span></p>

<p dir="rtl"><span class="c2">וְהָאִישׁ מֹשֶׁה עָנָו מְאֹד מִכֹּל הָאָדָם אֲשֶׁר עַל פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">And the man Moses was very humble, more than any other men which were upon the
face of the earth.</span>(Numbers 12:3)      </p>
    </div><div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="c1">
One may ask in what manner did Moses surpass all other individuals in
the character trait of humility. And it appears to our master to explain
this according to the words of the prophet (Jeremiah 9:22-23): "Let not
the wise man glory in his wisdom, let not the mighty man glory in his
might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him who glories
glory in this, that he understands, and knows Me." For only one who is
enlightened to seek the Deity and to know the sublime knowledge is fit
to be glorified and praised. But not so for the one who is wise or
mighty or rich, for these are all the gift of G-d. And when the prophet
concludes "For in these things I delight, says the Lord," he meant to
say that it is by the will of G-d that the wise man became wise, the
mighty man mighty and the rich man rich.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
Now we have already cited the Ran in his twelve drashot that the level
to which Moses our teacher ascended to know the Eternal face to face was
not owing to any preparation of his own. For it is beyond human capacity
to rise up to so great an achievement, and it would have been impossible
to do so without the aid of the Eternal. Only out of the necessity that
the Torah be given through him did the Eternal elevate Moses to this
level. Moses's greatness was thus a gift from the Almighty. (See what we
have written concerning this in פרשת בלק). Moses therefore did not
even take glory from his knowledge and understanding of the Eternal,
because that knowledge and understanding was given to him entirely from
the hand of the Eternal. And that is why he was the most humble of all men.
