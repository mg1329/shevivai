This is alluded to in what is written (Psalms 34:13-15): "Who is the man
who desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your
tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Depart from evil,
and do good; seek peace, and pursue it" (
מִי הָאִישׁ הֶחָפֵץ חַיִּים אֹהֵב יָמִים לִרְאוֹת טוֹב.
נְצֹר לְשׁוֹנְךָ מֵרָע  וּשְׂפָתֶיךָ מִדַּבֵּר מִרְמָה.
סוּר מֵרָע וַעֲשֵׂה-טוֹב בַּקֵּשׁ שָׁלוֹם וְרָדְפֵהוּ
). 
This may
be compared to the case of the peddler who used to go round the towns in
the vicinity of Sepphoris, crying out: "Who wishes to buy the elixir of
life?" and drew great crowds round him. R. Jannai was sitting and
expounding in his room and heard the peddler's call. He said to him,
"please come here and sell it to me." The peddler replied, "Neither you
nor people like you require that [which I have to sell]." The Rabbi
insisted, and the peddler went up to him and he came up. The peddler
took out a book of Pslams and showed him the passage, "Who is the man
who desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good." What is
written {immediately] thereafter?-- "Keep your tongue from evil, depart
from evil and do good." . . . R. Jannai said: "All my life have I been
reading this passage, but did not know how it was to be explained until
this hawker came and made it clear," viz., "Who is the man who desires
life...? Keep your tongue from evil, etc." It is for the same reason
that Moses addressed a warning to Israel, saying to them, a'This shall
be the law of the leper (מְּצֹרָע)" i.e. the law relating to one that
gives currency to an evil report (מוציא [שם] רע).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And the question is what did R. Jannai not understand about this verse,
and what did he learn after the peddler showed him the verse that he
hadn't known before? Many have already discussed the verse, and our
master has also offered an explanation from his soul.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
What is very obscure about this verse is that at first it offers life to
anyone who desires it at the minimal price: "keep your tongue from evil
and your lips from speaking deceit." But is this not a small thing? And
yet his life will be saved by it? (הלא מצער היא ותרי נפשו באלה). 
But then the Scripture takes back everything by then saying:
"Depart from evil." In other words, observe all the negative
commandments of the Torah. "And do good." In other words, also perform
all the positive commandments in the Torah. But if one can gain life
only by fulfilling the Torah in its entirety, then why did the Scripture
at first mention just the commandment to guard one's tongue from evil?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, the "life" that this verse is referring to is to avoid becoming
a leper (מְּצֹרָע) inasmuch as a leper is considered to be like a dead
person. The point of the verse is thus to admonish against the sin of
slander for which one is punished with leprosy, as is suggested by the
word "מְּצֹרָע" which is a short form of "מוציא [שם] רע". The verse is
therefore trying to provide us with advice about how to avoid sin of
slander, and it does so in the light of a Midrash which says that
speaking ill about a person causes the death of three people: the one
who slanders, the one who listens to the slander, and the one who is
slandered because of some action of his that caused others to speak ill
about him. And this is what the Psalmist was referring to when he asked
"who is the man who desires life?" That is, who wants to avoid being
stricken with leprosy? "Keep your tongue from evil." This is the general
principle, which is followed by specific details. "And your lips from
speaking deceit" means "do not slander another person." "Depart from
evil" means "distance yourself from those who slander others and do not
care what they say about others." However, one has not yet secured his
life against the possibility of punishment. For one must also "do good"
by doing what is right and just in the eyes of G-d and man 
(הישר והטוב בעיני אלקים ואדם), so that he will not give sinners a
pretext for slandering him.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now when this peddler shouted out his announcement "who wants to buy an
elixir of life?" and then took out a book of Psalms from his pocket and
showed R. Jannai this verse, he taught R. Jannai that the verse was
merely an antidote for the affliction of leprosy. For the business of
peddlers is to sell antidotes and treatments to those afflicted with, or
who seek to avoid, illness. From this, R. Jannai understood that the
entire verse was referring only to the sin of slander. That insight
resolved all the difficulties with the verse that had previously
troubled him.

Rashi comments:
Because the plagues of leprosy come as a punishment for slander, which
is the result of chattering, birds, which chatter continuously with a
twittering sound, are compulsory for the leper's purification.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
וְעֵץ אֶרֶז (and cedar wood) (Id.)
Rashi comments:
This lofty tree was used because plagues come as a punishment for
haughtiness.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
וּשְׁנִי תוֹלַעַת וְאֵזֹב (and scarlet and hyssop) (Id.)
Rashi comments:
What remedy should he use to be healed? Let him, abandoning his pride,
regard himself as a worm (tola'at) and as hyssop (eizov)
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now one could ask about these symbolic hints why one bird was not enough
to suggest chattering and why one was slaughtered and the other let go
into the open field. Moreover, the symbolic comparison of the cedar to
haughtiness and the symbolic comparison of the worm and the hyssop to
meekness do not seem to conform to the symbolic interpretation given to
the two birds, because the birds indicate how he committed his sin,
while the cedar and the worm and the hyssop indicate both the sin and
the manner in which it must be repaired.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It therefore appears to our master that the metaphorical hints can be
reconciled by recognizing that one who speaks slanderously is an
exceedingly haughty person who says "I and only I," who sees the defects
of everyone but himself. He mocks and assigns blame to everyone right
and left. This is an evil affliction and a familiar ailment. However,
the extremely humble and meek person who shuts his eyes not to see the
evil done by his neighbor, by refusing to rebuke his neighbor and cause
him to depart from his evil ways, does not conduct himself properly
either. Instead of standing in the breach to do battle for G-d against
the destroyers of the faith, he hides himself away. This is why in the
Talmud (Hulin 89a) the Sages deduce from the verse (Psalms 58:2)
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
What is the meaning of the verse: "Indeed in silence speak
righteousness; judge uprightly the sons of men" 
(הַאֻמְנָם אֵלֶם צֶדֶק תְּדַבֵּרוּן מֵישָׁרִים תִּשְׁפְּטוּ בְּנֵי אָדָם)? What should be a man's
pursuit in this world? He should be silent. Perhaps he should be so with
regard to the words of the Torah? It says therefore, 'Speak righteousness'.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
If it is indeed best for one to be mute without opening one's mouth to
argue with others to criticize them, one must nevertheless "speak
righteousness" in a mighty voice and reprove the misdeeds and injustices
of others for the sake of righteousness and fairness, so that others may
repent of their misconduct. Now the leper is one who is haughty and
arrogant, one who speaks freely and erroneously. So if we want to offer
advice to him about how to improve his conduct, we must first instruct
him to become modest and humble and give up his conceit. But, at the
same time, we must also teach him that he should not go to the other
extreme of excessive meekness. For there is a time for everything - a
time to go out boldly against those who do evil, when one must raise
himself up for the sake of G-d to fight with an outstretched arm. This
is the symbolism of the two live birds. One bird must be slaughtered to
show that the leper must extinguish that propensity to speak which leads
to sin. However, the bird that is sent out over the open field is meant
to show that, when the time comes, one must speak out publicly and raise
one's voice to speak out for the sake of the Eternal. And there is a
similar symbolism in the cedar tree and the hyssop and worm, for
sometimes one must raise himself up as high as a cedar to do battle, but
at other times one must lower his soul as low as a hyssop and a worm.
