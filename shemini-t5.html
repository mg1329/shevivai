Our master explained that the meaning of this verse is that a person can
achieve moral perfection only by learning to simultaneously love and
fear the Eternal, so that his love of and his fear for the Eternal grow
stronger in equal measure. As the Psalmist says (Psalms 2:11): "Serve
the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling" 
(עִבְדוּ אֶת ה' בְּיִרְאָה וְגִילוּ בִּרְעָדָה). 
Thus, any commandment that is not performed with both
trepidation and love lacks the two wings with which to ascend upward.
And should a burning love inflame someone to transgress an ordinance
(חק) in order to approach the Eternal too closely, it is fear that must
cause him to draw back. For many have been brought down because their
love for G-d caused them to approach Him too closely.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
So, too, did Nadav and Avihu sin by approaching too closely the inner
sanctum of the Eternal. As the wise commentators have written, they
dared, owing to the intensity of their love for the Eternal, to ascend
bareheaded before Him, removing the veil of fear from their faces, and,
as a consequence, they died. From this incident, the great and wise ones
of the nation, who are closest to G-d, drew the lesson that they dare
not ascend to the Eternal lest they be consumed by fire, as were these
two pious and exceedingly righteous ones who died so suddenly. But the
simple people of the nation, who do not really understand what love of
the Eternal entails, took the opposite lesson: to serve G-d with joy and
a good heart, to love Him and to cling to Him, because they saw how
precious it is, in the eyes of the Eternal, to worship Him with love and
not with indifference. For if it were not for their indifference, these
righteous ones, with a great and surpassing love, surely (the simple
people suppose) would not have stumbled, and no ill would have befallen
them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Thus, holiness causes fear - fear of exaltation and anxiety at holiness,
as it is written (Leviticus 19:30) "and fear my sanctuary" 
(וּמִקְדָּשִׁי תִּירָאוּ). 
But honor and glory are a sign of love, because one gives honor
to that which he loves, as the Sages say in the Talmud, explaining why
in the commandment to "honor thy father and thy mother" "father"
precedes "mother." [Since the natural inclination is to love one's
mother more than one's father, it was necessary to underscore the duty
to honor one's father by mentioning the father first.] It is therefore
written "this is what the Lord spoke I will be sanctified in them that
come near to me" (הוּא אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר ה' בִּקְרֹבַי אֶקָּדֵשׁ). That is
to say, because of this incident, those that are close to the Eternal
and cling to Him will become sanctified and reverential in fearing Him.
However, "and before all the people I will be glorified" 
(וְעַל פְּנֵי כָל הָעָם אֶכָּבֵד). 
In other words, because the ordinary people (who are not
so close to the Eternal) will learn from the incident to love Me and, as
a result, I will be honored in their midst.

In Midrash Rabbah it is asked:
What could Aaron have said? "On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin
shall be circumcised" (וביום השמיני ימול בשר ערלתו).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This remark is an astonishing mystery. But we heard from the holy mouth
of our master a correct explanation which he said in the name of his
father the gaon (R. Avraham Glasner, 1826-78). The law is that if a
woman's first two sons died after being circumcised, the third son may
not be circumcised, because there is a presumption that circumcision
would endanger the life of any subsequent sons that are born. Thus, when
the two sons of Aaron were killed because they approached the Eternal to
perform a service, the danger to Aaron's sons had been confirmed, and
Aaron could have broken the chains of the priesthood that were upon him
and said, "behold I am going to die because of it." Since he could have
used the law of circumcision to support his position, but instead
remained quiet, he was rewarded.

The Midrash Rabbah (Leviticus 13:1) comments:
In three instances did Moses lose his temper and [in consequence] a law
escaped his memory [on each occasion], and the following are the
instances: In respect of the Sabbath, of metal utensils, and of an onen
(i.e., whether the sin-offering of Aaron could be eaten by an onen).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Many have objected that here in the incident of the sin-offering of
Aaron, the order was reversed, because Moses became angry only because
he erred in his halakhic ruling. See the Sifra which records an opinion
that disputes the premise that Moses erred because of his anger and
asserts rather that Moses became angry because he erred.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, the Midrash appears unobjectionable to our master, because a
wise and understanding person is not quick to respond and will not say
anything until he has weighed carefully whether it correct. Should an
incorrect idea occur to such a person, he would therefore certainly
reconsider it before saying it out loud. Scientists have, in this
manner, broken down every thought that leads to some action into four
components: conception (מחשבה פשוטה), reflection (התבוננות),
affirmation (הסכמה), and finally speech or action. Thus, as soon as
Moses conceived the thought (מחשבה פשוטה) that Aaron had acted
improperly, he became angry, which caused his reflection (התבוננות)
and affirmation (הסכמה) to be in error. The Midrash therefore
correctly attributed his mistake to anger, because it was only because
of his anger that he mentally affirmed the initial idea that he had
wrongly conceived.
