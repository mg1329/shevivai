          לסדר בראשית </span></p>
      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> וַיַּעַשׂ אֱלֹהִים אֶת-הָרָקִיעַ
          וַיַּבְדֵּל בֵּין הַמַּיִם אֲשֶׁר מִתַּחַת לָרָקִיעַ וּבֵין
          הַמַּיִם אֲשֶׁר מֵעַל לָרָקִיעַ וַיְהִי כֵן </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">And G-d made the firmament, and divided the
          waters which were under the firmament from the waters which
          were above the firmament; and it was so (Genesis 1:7) </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The Ramban asks why immediately after telling
          us that G-d made the firmament (ויעש את הרקיע), the Scritpure
          writes "וַיְהִי כֵן" (and it was so), indicating that G-d's
          commandment that the firmament come into existence was already
          realized. And our master said in the name of his father the
          gaon (R. Avraham Glasner, 1826-78) that the Scripture meant to
          distinguish between this commandment ( יְהִי רָקִיעַ) and the next
          one, "יִקָּווּ הַמַּיִם" (let the waters under the firmament be
          gathered into one place). For the Ramban wrote that the Holy
          One Blessed Be He originally created just one substance from
          absolute nothingness; after this general substance came into
          existence it could then be transformed into the four primary
          elements (earth, wind, fire, and water). Only then did the
          Holy One Blessed Be He command these four elements to be
          transformed into all the material things that we experience. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> It is known by scientists that the properties
          of the four elements would have made it impossible for the
          land to be above sea level, because earth is heavier than
          water. The earth should therefore have sunk to the bottom of
          the mighty waters. The Holy One Blessed Be He therefore
          brought about a phenomenon contrary to the laws of nature when
          He said "let the waters under the firmament be gathered into
          one place, and let the dry land appear," because the waters
          gathered in a low place and the land rose above sea level. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> In this way, our master's father explained
          what King David said (Psalms 24:1), "the earth is the L-rd's
          and the fulness thereof, the world and those who dwell
          therein." This means that one can prove that the world did not
          always exist, but was, instead, the creation of G-d from the
          fact that "He has founded it on the seas and established it on
          the rivers" (Psalms 24:2), which is contrary to the natural
          tendency of the elements. The Scripture therefore writes "and
          G-d made the firmament and separated the waters . . . and it
          was so," to teach us, as the Ramban explains, that they were
          separated from the time that the first substance was created.
          The separation between the waters did, indeed, conform to the
          natural tendency. However, the commandment "let the waters
          under the firmament be gathered into one place, and let the
          dry land appear" was contrary to the natural tendency.
          Nevertheless, it came to pass as G-d decreed, for it was done
          by the Hand of G-d. </span></p>

    <div style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right:

      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים לֹא-טוֹב
          הֱיוֹת הָאָדָם לְבַדּוֹ אֶעֱשֶׂה-לּוֹ עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ
          <!--  ויאמר ה' אלהים וגו' אעשה לו עזר כנגדו --> </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> And the Lord G-d said, It is not good that
          the man should be alone; I will make him a help to match him
          (Genesis 2:18) </span></p>
      <span class="c1"></span></div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> In the Talmud the Sages comment, "if a man is
          worthy (זכה), she is a help meet (עזר), if he is not worthy
          (לא זכה), she becomes his opponent" (כנגדו). And it appears to
          our master to say that a man who lives alone without a wife
          must be constantly busy, working both inside and outside his
          home with not even a moment left for Torah and wisdom. And
          this is why they say in the Talmud that R. Yosi called his
          wife, "my house." However, a married man is free from domestic
          responsibilities and may devote himself to the service of G-d.
          So if one dedicates the time that need not be devoted to
          domestic obligations to the service of G-d, then, because his
          conduct is meritorious, the wife that G-d gave him is
          considered a help meet. But if one uses the time that he has
          gained to prowl the streets with the lads and make merry with
          the jesters, then his wife will be considered a curse, and she
          becomes his nemesis, for he would have been better off had he
          been obliged to look after his home than to occupy himself
          with nonsense. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> However, if our Sages have explained the
          first verse, how can they explain the next verse which says,
          "and the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the
          air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was
          not found a help meet for him"? And it appears to our master
          that the Torah is hinting at a great idea here, since there
          are gentile scholars who maintain that man is born as a wild
          ass and is the descendant of apes. But how have their eyes
          been dimmed from seeing! For did the Sages not say (Bekhorot
          8a) that there are three types of creatures that have conjugal
          relations facing each other: fish, snakes and people? Besides
          these three, all others, including the apes, have conjugal
          relations in the opposite way. And it appears to our master
          that, before its legs were cut off, the snake also had
          conjugal relations as do all other creatures, so that among
          all the creatures only fish in the water had conjugal
          relations in the manner of man on the land. And it is
          impossible that apes would have changed to the manner of
          having conjugal relations of a human being. Thus when the
          Torah said that among all animals on the land, the man could
          not find a help meet "כְּנֶגְדּוֹ", it meant that he could not find
          a partner with whom he could have conjugal relations face to
          face. Therefore G-d said, "I will make a help meet for him." </span></p>

      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"><bdo dir="rtl"> וְאֵיבָה אָשִׁית
            בֵּינְךָ וּבֵין הָאִשָּׁה וּבֵין זַרְעֲךָ וּבֵין זַרְעָהּ
            הוּא יְשׁוּפְךָ רֹאשׁ וְאַתָּה תְּשׁוּפֶנּוּ עָקֵב
            <!--  ואיבה אשית וכו' הוא ישופך ראש ואתה תשופנו עקב--> </bdo></span>
      </p>
      <p><span class="c2"> And I will put enmity between you and the
          woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise
          your head, and you shall bruise his heel (Genesis 3:15) </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> Our master explained this as a hint to the
          comment of the Midrash that the verse (Psalms 49:6): "why
          should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of my
          persecutors surrounds me" is referring to the days of Rosh
          Hashanah and Yom Hakippurim. Kind David is saying here that he
          does not fear for his soul because of great sins, because he
          can gain forgiveness for those sins if he repents for them
          with all his heart. However, he dreaded the sins that a person
          performs routinely and to which, as a result, he becomes
          accustomed, so that he does not even think about repenting for
          them. This is what was meant by "he shall bruise your head"
          (הוּא יְשׁוּפְךָ רֹאשׁ), which means that when a person repents on
          Rosh Hashanah for his great sins he bruises the head of the
          serpent, i.e., Satan, the instigator and seducer, and
          frustrates all his efforts. But G-d tells the serpent "you
          shall bruise his heel" (וְאַתָּה תְּשׁוּפֶנּוּ עָקֵב), which means that
          Satan is able to snare man in those transgressions that he
          does routinely, which are very difficult to repent of, because
          after constant repetition, the transgressions begin to seem as
          if they are permissible. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right:
      50px;">
      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> אֶל הָאִשָּׁה אָמַר הַרְבָּה
          אַרְבֶּה עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ וְהֵרֹנֵךְ בְּעֶצֶב תֵּלְדִי בָנִים
          <!--  ואל האשה אמר הרבה ארבה עצבונך והמונך בעצב תלדי בנים -->
        </span> </p>
      <p> <span class="c2"> To the woman He said, I will greatly
          multiply the pain of your child bearing; in sorrow you shall
          bring forth children (Genesis 3:16) </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p> <span class="c1"> Rashi comments on "עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ" (your pain)
          "this is the pain of child rearing;" on "והרונך" he comments
          "this is the pain of pregnancy" and on "בעצב תלדי בנים" (in
          pain shall you give birth) he comments "this is the pain of
          child-birth." But the order is reversed as everyone can see.
          Ibn Ezra protected himself against this and interpreted
          "עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ" as the pain of losing virginity. And it appears to
          our master to say that both of these great commentators were
          interpreting the verse in consistent way, which can be traced
          back to their explanation of the verse (Genesis 4:1): "now
          Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain,
          saying, 'I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord.'"
          Rashi interprets this verse according to the opinion that this
          occurred before the sin and she immediately conceived and gave
          birth. But Ibn Ezra interprets the verse according to the
          opinion that this occurred after the sin, when they realized
          that they were mortal and wished to perpetuate their species.
          Thus, Rashi, according to his interpretation, did follow the
          order correctly by interpreting "עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ" as the pain of child
          rearing of the sons she already had: Cain and Abel, whom she
          lost on a single day when Cain killed Abel and Cain left her
          into exile as a nomad. Rashi then interprets "הֵרֹנֵךְ" and "בְּעֶצֶב 
	  תֵּלְדִי" as referring to the children that she would bear
          subsequently. And see the Talmud in Eruvin, which derives both
          from the repetition of the words "הַרְבָּה אַרְבֶּה". </span> </p>
