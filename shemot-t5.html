          And she said: "This is one of the Hebrews'
          children". . . . and she named him Moses for she said,

          Many have asked why the daughter of Pharoah called the child
          "משה."
          If the name was meant to indicate that she had drawn him from
          the water,
          she ought to have called him "משוי" (one who is drawn), not
          "מֹשֶׁה" (one who draws).
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          But it appears to our master that the daughter of Pharaoh was
          commemorating the miracle that had occurred to her on that day
          when she
          took pity on this alien child, saving him from the deadly
          waters, and
          resolved to raise him as her own son. So she placed upon him a
          sign that
          wold indicate that it was he that was destined to redeem
          Israel from the
          bondage of Egypt. Pharaoh's astrologers had already foreseen
          that on
          that particular day the redeemer of Israel would be born, but
          they could
          not tell if the child would be an Israelite or an Egyptian.
          That is why,
          as Rashi explains, Pharaoh commanded his people to cast every
          son,
          including Egyptians, that was born on that day into the river,
          but every
          daughter was allowed to live (Exodus 1:22). What the
          astrologers could
          not see clearly was from which people the future redeemer
          would be
          descended. And the reason was that Moses was considered both
          an
          Israelite and an Egyptian inasmuch as his natural mother was
          יוכבד,
          while the daughter of Pharaoh raised him as her own beloved.
          Moses was
          therefore considered to be her son as well, as, indeed, it is
          written
          (Exodus 2:10): "and he became her son" (וַיְהִי לָהּ לְבֵן). In the
          Talmud the Sages deduce from this verse that one who raises an
          orphan in
          his house is considered by the Scripture to have given birth
          to the
          child. That is why the astrologers were confused and could not
          tell
          whether the child destined to become the redeemer would be an
          Israelite
          or an Egyptian.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          So when the daughter of Pharaoh took the child for herself she
          unraveled
          the enigma of why the astrologers had been unable to identify
          the origin
          of the child. And that was a sign to her that this was indeed
          the child
          destined to redeem Israel from the grip of Egypt. She
          therefore said,
          "מִיַּלְדֵי הָעִבְרִים זֶה" (it is from the children of the Hebrews),
          for
          what she meant to say was: this child that the astrologers
          foresaw would
          be born today and would become the redeemer of Israel is
          indeed from the
          children of the Hebrews, but they could not see that, because
          it is I
          who shall raise him." And, thinking of the future when he
          would redeem
          Israel, she named him "מֹשֶׁה" (one who redeems). But she did not
          disclose what she was thinking. Instead she said, "Because I
          drew him
          out of the water" (וַתֹּאמֶר כִּי מִן הַמַּיִם מְשִׁיתִהוּ). Thus, she only
          stated that the reason she called him "מֹשֶׁה" was because she
          drew him
          out of the water, while hiding her real intent, which was to
          symbolize
          his destiny as the redeemer of Israel. She therefore called
          him "מֹשֶׁה"
          before giving any reason for his name, which indicates that
          the stated
          reason for the name was not the true reason. See also the
          explanation of
          our master in פר' ויצא concerning the naming of ראובן, which
          is also based on the idea that when the stated reason for a
          name is
          given after the naming of the child, that reason is not the
          real reason
          for the name.

          Rashi comments:
          because he had not circumcised his son אליעזר and because he
          had been
          remiss in performing this commandment, he brought upon himself
          the
          punishment of death. It was taught in a baraita: R. Yosi said:
          G-d
          forbid that this was so. Moses was not remiss, but he thought,
          "If I
          circumcise him and immediately proceed on the journey, the
          child's life
          will be in danger for three days. If, on the other hand, I
          circumcise
          him and wait three days - the Holy One Blessed Be He has
          commanded me to
          return to Egypt. [Consequently, he obeyed the commandment,
          intending to
          circumcise the child at the first opportunity.] Why, then, was
          he
          punished? Because, upon arrival, he busied himself with the
          lodging
          place first [before circumcising the child].
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          This is from the Gemara in Nedarim 32a. Rashi, the Rosh and
          the Ran all
          explain there that the lodging place was close to Egypt, so
          that the
          child was no longer in any danger. And the gaon of blessed
          memory (R.
          Avraham Glasner 1826-78), the father of our master asked a
          powerful
          question: how could they say that the lodging place was close
          to Egypt?
          Did not Aaron meet Moses at Mount Horeb, the mountain of G-d,
          as it is
          written (Exodus 4:27) "and [Aaron] met him at the mountain of
          G-d"
          (ויפגשהו בהר האלהים). And Aaron said to him: "we have cause
          to grieve over the Israelites that are already here and you
          propose to
          add to their number?" (See Rashi Exodus 18:2). If so, the
          lodging place
          at which צפורה circumcised אליעזר must have been close to
          Mount
          Horeb since she returned from there to her father's house, and
          Mount
          Horeb was close to מדין since Moses came there while he was
          shepherding the sheep of Jethro.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          And our master explains that Hazal said that at the very
          moment that
          Moses was told to return to Egypt, Aaron was told to go to
          meet Moses.
          So, when Moses went to Egypt from Midian via Mount Horeb, they
          were
          reunited in peace at that place, which was where Aaron advised
          Moses to
          send צפורה and her sons to her father's house. But if צפורה
          was
          returning to Midian, then Moses should have circumcised אליעזר
          there,
          because he was near to Jethro's house and there was no danger
          in
          circumcising him. But because he busied himself first with the
          lodging
          place, he was punished. And this is true and correct. It is
          also
          possible that the words of the Rishonim were "סמוך למדין,"
          which
          the copyists misunderstood and mistakenly rendered as "סמוך
          למצרים" instead.

          And the Lord

          Rashi comments:
          "Now you will see" - what will be done to Pharaoh now you will
          see, but
          you will not see what will be done to the kings of Canaan when
          I shall
          bring them to into the Holy Land.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          From these words of Rashi it appears that because Moses said
          (Exodus
          5:22) "why hast Thou done evil to this people" (למה הרעותה לעם
          הזה), it was decreed that he would not enter the Holy Land.
          But this
          is a wonder, because the Scripture explicitly states at the
          incident of
          the Waters of Strife (מי מריבה) at Qadesh (Numbers 20:12):
          "Because
          you did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the
          children of
          Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the
          land which
          I have given them"( 
	  יַעַן לֹא הֶאֱמַנְתֶּם בִּי לְהַקְדִּישֵׁנִי לְעֵינֵי בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל לָכֵן לֹא תָבִיאוּ אֶת
הַקָּהָל הַזֶּה אֶל הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר נָתַתִּי לָהֶם).
	  </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          And it appears to our master that Moses's transgression at מי
          מריבה
          and his transgression in asking "lamah hareiotah" were alike,
          because
          both times Moses offended the honor of the Children of Israel
          by
          suggesting that they were unworthy of having miracles
          performed in their
          behalf. At the incident of מי מריבה, he said to them (Numbers
          20:10):
          "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you from
          this
          rock?" (שִׁמְעוּ נָא הַמֹּרִים הֲמִן הַסֶּלַע הַזֶּה, נוֹצִיא לָכֶם מָיִם) He
          called them rebels who were unworthy of having such miracles
          performed
          for them. Here, too, he transgressed when he said: "לָמָה
          הֲרֵעֹתָה לָעָם הַזֶּה." The word "עם" signifies that they are on a low level.
          And
          he continued: "Why didst Thou ever send me?" (לָמָּה זֶּה שְׁלַחְתָּנִי),
          just as when he asked earlier (Exodus 3:11): "and that I
          should bring forth the people of Israel out of Egypt?" 
	  (וכי אשיא את בנ"י ממצרים) where Rashi explains that he meant to say: "how have
          they
          merited that I should miraculously bring them forth from
          Egypt?"
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          Since we see that at the incident of מי מריבה Moses was denied
          entry
          into the Holy Land, because he offended the honor of the
          Chosen People,
          the question arises why Moses was not punished similarly here
          and denied
          the opportunity of seeing the Exodus from Egypt? However,
          there is, in
          truth, a great difference between the two transgressions. For
          when Moses
          said to them "Hear now, you rebels," Israel had already
          accepted the
          Torah, and had risen to a higher spiritual level, so that
          Moses grossly
          exaggerated by calling them rebels. But in Egypt, Israel was
          still on a
          low spiritual level, as the Sages say in the Midrash, even the
          angels of
          service protested: "how are these (the Israelites) different
          from these
          (the Egyptians), they are all idolaters." Moses's
          transgression in Egypt
          was therefore not as severe as his transgression at the
          incident of מי מריבה. Here then is the meaning of the words
          "now you will see": "Even
          though now you have committed a transgression like the one
          that will
          cause you to be denied the opportunity to see the Holy Land,
          and,
          therefore, in justice, you ought now to be denied the
          opportunity to see
          the Exodus from Egypt, nevertheless this time you will be
          allowed to see
          the Exodus." And the Scripture continues and explains the
          reason: "for
          with a strong hand he will send them out, yea, by a strong
          hand he shall
          drive them out of his land." In other words: "the people of
          Israel
          really are not worthy of redemption, and under the Divine
          attribute of
          Justice (מידת הדין) they would be condemned, so that only with
          a
          strong hand will I be able to take them out and the Right Hand
          of G-d
          will work valiantly to overcome the </span><span class="c1">מידת
          הדין</span><span class="c1">. But you will not see
          the war against the thirty-one kings of Canaan, because of a
          similar
          transgression at מֵי מְרִיבָה. Your transgression of heaping scorn
          and
          contempt upon them at that time will be more serious than this
          transgression, because they will then be better, and on a
          higher
          spiritual level, than they are now."
