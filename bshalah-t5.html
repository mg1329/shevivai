And it came to
pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, G-d did not lead them by way
of the land of the Philistines

In Midrash Rabbah it is deduced that "וַיְהִי" (and it came to pass) is
an expression of lament (לשון צער). The Midrash offers many
explanations of who it was that cried "woe" the people left Egypt. But
it appears to our master that it is the Torah that raised her voice and
cried "woe," because, until Pharaoh chased them out with a strong hand,
the children of Israel did not want to leave Egypt, but preferred to
stay in that murky valley. G-d therefore "did not lead them by way of the
land of the Philistines, although that was near, for G-d said, lest the
people repent when they see war, and return to Egypt."

There the Lord made for them a statute and an
ordinance . . . saying, "If you will diligently hearken to the voice of
the Lord your G-d, and do what is right in His eyes, and give heed to
his commandments, and keep all his statutes. . ."

Rashi explains:
At Marah he gave them a few sections of the Torah in order that they
might engage in the study thereof; namely, the sections concerning the
Sabbath, the red heifer (פרה אדומה), and the laws of justice (דינים).
</span></p>      <p><span class="c1"> 
Our master gave a twofold reason for the choice of these three sections.
The Eternal wanted to provide the Israelites at Marah with one
commandment as an example of each of the three categories of
commandments that are in the Torah. The three categories are the
commandments of reason (מצות השכליים), the commandments of
understanding (מצות השמע), and the statutes (חוקים). They were
informed about the commandments at Marah just as a prospective convert
is informed about some of the easy commandments and some of the
difficult commandments, so that the convert might be able to draw some
inference from those commandments about the other commandments. The
commandments of reason are those that we already know ourselves from our
own reason, and which, even had we not been commanded to observe them,
we ourselves would have understood ought to be kept. Corresponding to
these commandments, G-d instructed them in the laws of justice (דינים)
which are derived from reason. Then there are the commandments of
understanding (מצות שמע) which are commandments that we would not
have known ourselves without being commanded to observe them, but upon
hearing them, we find reason to understand and praise them. And
corresponding to this category, G-d commanded them to observe the
Sabbath while explaining to them that reason for its observance is that
it is an eternal sign of the covenant between G-d and the people of
Israel. And the statutes (חוקים) are those commandments which our
understanding is too limited to comprehend even after we have heard
them. And corresponding to this category, G-d gave them the law of the
red heifer, whose ways are hidden from us.
</span></p>      <p><span class="c1"> 
This explains why the Scripture says (Exodus 15:26): "If you will
diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your G-d" which is a general
statement encompassing the entire Torah, its laws of justice
(משפמיה), statutes (חקותיה), and testimonies (עדותיה). The
Scripture then mentions specifically "and will do that which is right in
His eyes," referring to the commandments of reason that they were able
to know would be right in the eyes of G-d even if they had not been
commanded accordingly. Next the Scripture says "and you shall give heed
to His commandments," refering to the commandments of understanding
which we first hear and understand only afterwards. Finally, the
Scripture says, "and keep all His statutes," referring to the
commandments whose reason and purpose are hidden, and whose manner of
observance is distant.
