          Rashi explains that this refers to monetary oppression. Below
          (Leviticus
          25:17) it is written: "You shall not wrong one another" (ולא
          תונו איש את עמיתו), and Rashi explains:
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          Here the Scripture warns about verbal oppression, and the
          Scripture
          therefore writes: "and you shall fear your G-d" (ויראת מאלהיך)
          because He knows that which is given over to the heart.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          And it is a wonder that on this verse: "and if you sell
          something to
          your neighbor or buy from your neighbor" (וכי תמכרו ממכר
          לעמיתך או קנה מיד עמיתך אל תונו איש את אחיו), the Midrash says
          (Leviticus Rabbah
          33:1): </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          This bears on the text (Proverbs 18:21) "Death and life are in
          the power
          of the tongue" (מות וחיים ביד לשון וכו').
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          Thus, the Midrash, unlike Rashi, understands the first verse
          to refer to
          verbal oppression. However, this interpretation is untenable,
          because
          the Scripture explicitly refers in this verse to an act of
          purchase or
          of sale.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          But it appears to our master that the Midrash meant to explain
          why the
          Scripture writes "וכי תמכרו ממכר" (and if you sell something
          that
          is sold) when it would have been more appropriate to write
          "וכי תמכרו דבר או חפץ" (and if you sell a thing or an object)
          inasmuch
          as the word "ממכר" applies only after the object has already
          been sold
          and not before. See the interpretative rules of the Malbim.
          One could
          also ask why the Scripture did not write the conjugated form
          "תקנו"
          (you will buy) parallel to "תמכרו" rather than the root form
          "קנה"
          (buy) (i.e., וכי תמכרו ממכר לעמיתך או תקנו מיד עמיתך). The
          Midrash
          therefore explains that with this golden expression the Torah
          wanted to
          inform us of a great precept, which is that if the buyer knows
          that the
          seller is selling because he is in financial distress and must
          sell his
          belongings, the buyer should not take advantage of the
          seller's distress
          and pay him less than the usual value of the object.
          Similarly, if the
          seller knows that the buyer very urgently wants his
          merchandise, he
          should not raise the price unduly.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          Now if the seller is forced by circumstances to sell his
          belongings,
          then the belongings may be considered as if they had already
          been sold
          to anyone willing to pay even a nominal price for them. (And
          see the
          words of our master about this in poroshat Mishpatim on כי
          תקנה עבד עברי.) That is why the Scripture says "if you sell
          something that is
          sold" referring to the object sold as "ממכר," i.e., something
          that has
          already been sold because of the distress of the seller.
          Similarly, the
          Scripture writes "או קנה מיד עמיתך" (or buy from the hand of
          your
          neighbor) using the root form to show the urgency of the
          purchase,
          because the buyer is willing to buy even before he reaches a
          fair
          bargain with the seller and is willing to pay whatever price
          he is asked
          by the seller. It is concerning such a situation that the
          Scripture
          warns "do not wrong each other" (אל תונו איש את אחיו), do not
          conduct
          yourself guilefully with your neighbor.
        </span></p>

          Now the Talmud discusses (Bava Kamma 7a) one who has houses,
          fields and
          vineyards, but cannot sell them. The Talmud asks how it is
          possible that
          he is not able to sell them, and the answer given is that
          since the
          seller is desperate for cash, the price of his property is
          depressed.
          This indicates that by divulging his financial distress to
          others, he
          has caused the value of his property to fall. So it is to such
          a
          situation that the Midrash is referring when it says that life
          and death
          are under the control of the tongue, for if a person is
          careful to guard
          his tongue and not to divulge his financial distress to
          anyone, what he
          is trying to sell would not be considered to have already been
          sold
          before he sold it. </span></p>

        <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> והארץ לא תמכר לצמיתות כי לי הארץ
            כי גרים ותושבים אתם עמדי ובכל ארץ אחוזתכם גאולה תתנו לארץ </span></p>
        <p><span class="c2"> The land
            shall not be sold forever; for the land is mine; for you are
            strangers

            And it may be questioned why this verse appears here. Does
            this entire
            chapter not speak about the sabbatical year for the land?
            And our master
            says that this verse also suggests the law of the sabbatical
            year, by
            telling us that the land may not be sold in perpetuity so
            that it would
            be tilled constantly. Rather, all the land belongs to the
            Eternal, and
            you are just strangers dwelling upon it. You are merely
            sojourners for
            as long as I desire it, and you may work the land for only
            six years,
            but on the seventh year, the land will enjoy its sabbath. </span></p>
