A Midrash included in Yalkut Eliezer quotes the verse (Psalms 13:6) "my
heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation, I will sing unto the Lord because
He has dealt bountifully with me" (יָגֵל לִבִּי בִּישׁוּעָתֶךָ אָשִׁירָה לַה׳ כִּי גָמַל עָלָי) and relates the words "my heart shall rejoice
in Thy salvation" to the miracle of Purim and "I will sing unto the
Lord" to the miracle of Hanukah.

[In other words, the Midrash uses the
verse to explain why Hallel, which is not recited on Purim, is recited
on Hanukah, inasmuch as the term for Hallel (ashirah) is used only in
the second part of the verse.]
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
And our master explained that the difference between the miracle of
Hanukah and the miracle of Purim is that on Purim it appeared clearly
that the Holy One Blessed Be He provided for the cure before the onset
of the disease in that Vashti was killed, which allowed Esther to enter
the house of the king. It was through this turn of events that Haman was
killed. And in the destruction of the wicked there is rejoicing, because
it led to the salvation of Israel. The public reading of the Megilah is
a sufficient celebration of the event, because from the recounting of
the events of the story everyone recognizes that the hand of G-d
miraculously guided everything, and that He alone saved their lives from
the sword and kept their enemies from overcoming them. However,
concerning the miracle of Hanukah, it would be possible to insinuate
that it was their military prowess that saved them, because, they
overcame their numerical disadvantage by risking their lives in a battle
for survival. But the truth is that human salvation is in vain. The
victory was achieved by the hand of G-d, for without the support of the
Almighty, all hope would have been lost. It is this which obligates us
to thank G-d and to praise Him forthrightly on Hanukah in order to
counter those who would say that it was our hand that was victorious. In
reciting Hallel, we proclaim that the salvation came from G-d.
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
This is the meaning of the verse "my heart shall rejoice in Thy
salvation." In the miracle of Esther, my heart will rejoice in Thy
salvation, because my heart can understand on its own that that famous
event resulted from the salvation of G-d. But concerning the miracle of
Hanukah, I must sing praises unto the Lord. There must be a special
recitation of thanks and praise to G-d to publicize the miracle. For
without the singing of G-d's praise, one could err, G-d forbid, and to
say that it was their courage and power that achieved victory over their
enemies.
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
Alternatively one could say that concerning the miracle of Purim only
"my heart will rejoice in Thy salvation," because only my heart can
rejoice in a salvation that did no more than to avoid the extermination
of Israel. However, such a salvation is not enough for us to go out in
song and psalm, because we remained the servants of Ahasueros, and we
still remain subject to the scorn and derision of the Gentiles who rule
over us and consider us slaves with whom they may do as they please. How
then can we listen to psalms of songs of rejoicing? But concerning the
miracle of Hanukah "I will sing unto the Lord." Concerning this
salvation it is appropriate to sing aloud in public, because the victory
over the enemy brought about the rule of the Hashmonaim as a result of
which we gained our freedom. On Purim, therefore, the reading of the
Megilah is sufficient, but on Hanukah we recite Hallel in gratitude for
our liberation.

<p><span class="c1"> 
The Gemara (Shabbat 21b) asks "what is Hanukah?" Rashi interprets the
question to be asking "in commemoration of which miracle did they
establish it?" The Gemara explains that it was established to
commemorate the miracle of the cruse of oil that burned for eight days.
This is an astonishing wonder, for why would G-d perform a miracle in
violation of the laws of nature just to enable some commandment to be
fulfilled? Did G-d require the light of the Menorah in the Temple? All
the miracles performed for our ancestors in days of old were to benefit
them and to save their lives from peril or to sustain them in famine,
for example the miracles at the Red Sea and in the desert. What would
G-d have lost if they had not performed that commandment? For were not
all the commandments given just to purify us by doing them, as Hazal say
"the Torah was given only to purify mankind." But if we do not have the
means by which to perform one of the commandments, we are considered to
have been under duress and the Torah exempts one who is under duress
from the obligation to perform a commandment. As the Sages have said, if
one intended to perform a commandment, but was prevented from doing so,
the Torah considers him to have performed it. If so, why did G-d
overturn the natural order to allow a quantity of oil sufficient to burn
for just one day to burn for eight days.?
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
And it appears to our master that the commandment to light the Menorah
is different from the other commandments, as the Sages remarked in the
Talmud (Shabbat 22b) about the verse (Leviticus 24:3) "Outside the veil
of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep in order from
the evening to morning before the Lord continually" 
(לְהַעֲלֹת נֵר תָּמִיד  כא בְּאֹהֶל מוֹעֵד מִחוּץ לַפָּרֹכֶת אֲשֶׁר עַל הָעֵדֻת  יַעֲרֹךְ אֹתוֹ אַהֲרֹן
וּבָנָיו מֵעֶרֶב עַד בֹּקֶר לִפְנֵי ה׳):
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
Does He then require the light? Surely during the entire forty years
that the Israelites travelled in the wilderness they traveled only by
His light. But it was a testimony to mankind that the Divine Presence
rests in Israel.
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
The Maharshah writes concerning that passage that it is impossible to
say that the eternal light, like other services performed in the Temple,
was a sweet savour (רֵיחַ נִיחוֹחַ לַה׳) to G-d. And see the sublime and
precious comment that we have written in פרשת בהעלותך, the
upshot of which is that the Menorah was not a commandment that the
people performed for G-d's sake. On the contrary, G-d commanded the High
Priest who served Him in the Temple to light it as a sign for the people
that G-d would shine His face upon them and would allow His glory to
dwell in their midst.
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
After Abraham our father returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and his
forces, G-d said to him: "Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward
shall be exceedingly great." Rashi explains that Abraham was afraid that
perhaps he had already received his full reward for the righteous deeds
that he had performed, so that even if he had defeated his enemies this
one time, perhaps the victory would not be permanent, because he was
unworthy of all the kindnesses that G-d had performed for him, so that
tomorrow or the next day his enemies would rule over him. G-d therefore
promised him that his reward would be very great, and it would be
everlasting. Similarly, when the spirit of G-d empowered the Hashmonaim
and they achieved a victory over their enemies, they were very worried
that their rule would not endure for long, because their reward from G-d
was already complete after He had miraculously delivered their enemies
into their hands. G-d therefore showed them a miracle through the
Menorah as a sign that He would seek their peace and well-being for all
time. The miraculous burning of the Menorah for eight days made it known
that G-d would dwell in their midst and would raise up His countenance
unto them for their good. For through the lighting of its lamps the
Menorah signifies that G-d shines His face unto the Hashmonaim and would
desire their well-being. And in the light of His countenance are life,
favor and kindness. The frightened spirit of the Hashmonaim was thereby
calmed, because they were reassured that G-d would watch over them and
protect them and no evil would befall them. They therefore commemorated
the miracle by prescribing the lighting of the lamp of Hanukah, because
it was through the lamp that their hearts were reassured that G-d had
achieved for them an enduring salvation and that their rule would
survive for a long time, as, indeed, it came to pass, for the reign of
the Hashmonaim lasted for many years.
