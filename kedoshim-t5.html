The commandment to revere one's father and mother is placed after the
commandment to be holy, because, as Rashi explains, this is where they
were commanded not to engage in any forbidden relationships and to
maintain the holiness of marriage. But the Ramban explains that the
commandment to be holy encompasses the entire Torah, so that one is
required to avoid certain acts even though they are not explicitly
prohibited by the Torah, for you are required to sanctify yourself
through that which is permitted to you (קדש עצמך במותר לך).

And it appears to our master that the commentators have already
explained that a person who even in his youth withholds himself from
physical pleasure and does not pursue his physical desires will merit to
have children who are faithful, who are of good character and of great
ability, and who can accept the Torah in purity. Such a child can then
follow in his father's footsteps, because he will have a proper role
model of his own flesh to follow. For if the child is conscientious, he
will understand that his parents have conducted themselves righteously
and uprightly and did not follow the desires of their hearts. The child
will then revere his parents and will accord them the reverence of honor
(יראת הכבוד). But if he is a rebellious son, of bad character, he
will not revere his parents and will not revere their greatness, because
his soul will attribute to his parents his own imperfections (as our
master explained in seder Toldot [ויאמר הקול קול יעקב והירים ידי
   עשיו] why Jacob revered his father more than his
brother Esau did). Thus, after the Scripture says "You shall be holy,"
it immediately says "every one of you shall revere his mother and his
father." For in the place of holiness is found the nest of reverence, as
the Sages deduce in the Talmud from the verse (Leviticus 19:30) "and
reverence my sanctuary" (ממקודשי תירא), "revere those who are holy
unto me."

 Rashi comments:R. Akiva said this is a great principle of the Torah
 (Toras Kohanim, Kedoshim 19:18;See also Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim 9:4)   
</p>      <p><span class="c1">
In the Talmud (Shabbat 31a) an incident is recounted concerning a
Gentile who came to Shammai and said, "Make me a proselyte on condition
that you teach me the whole Torah while I stand on one foot." Shammai
chased him away. The Gentile came to Hillel who converted him saying,
"whatever is hateful unto you, do not do to your friend. This is the
whole Torah, while the rest is commentary thereof. Go and study." And
our master revealed wonders in connection with this incident and
explained it with wisdom and understanding. For this Gentile did not
believe in the judgment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous
that is reserved for them in the world of eternity, because it is not
mentioned in the Torah. So he wanted to know what a mortal person gains
by observing all the commandments of the Torah and what he loses by
acting wickedly. He therefore asked Shammai to show him what benefit
there is in keeping the Torah while he stood on one foot, which meant
while he was standing here on the earth. By this he meant to say, do not
tell me that the explanation is too far removed from me to be
understood, so that I must take a long step with my other foot into the
grave to be among those asleep in the dust before I can understand the
benefit of observing the Torah. That is why Shammai chased him away and
replied angrily that if he did not believe that there would be reward
and punishment in the world of eternal life, then he would destroy the
entire structure, because here in the valley of tears it appears that
the wicked rejoice and thrive while the righteous person is lost despite
his righteousness. The houses of the wicked are full of bread and tasty
dishes, but in the pot of the man of G-d there is death. It is only in
the courtyards of our G-d that the righteous will inherit the earth and
take pleasure in the abundance of peace while the sinners will be
destroyed altogether and the wicked will at last be cut off.
</p>      <p><span class="c1">
However, when the Gentile came to Hillel, Hillel explained to him that
while a private individual is neither punished nor rewarded for his
deeds in this world, there is a reward here on earth for the actions of
the entire nation. If the nation keeps all the commandments and the
statutes, she will go on her way in peace and security and no one will
disturb her. The nation achieves happiness and success when she conducts
herself righteously and uprightly according to the Torah, and all her
people stand tall and are united in their purpose. It was the nation as
a whole that the Torah was addressing when it said (Leviticus 26:3): "If
you will walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them"
(אם בחקתי תלכו וכו') and
(Leviticus 26:15) "and if you will spurn my statutes and your soul
abhors my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but
break my covenant (ואם בחקתי תמאסו וכו'). But
if one man from the entire nation sins, every evil will not befall him,
and G-d will bring judgment upon him for all his actions only in the
world to come.
</p>      <p><span class="c1">
It was in this way that our master explained the verses at the end of
poroshat Nitzavim (Deuteronomy 29:18-20): "lest there be among you a
root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit, one who, when he hears the
words of this sworn covenant, blesses himself in his heart, saying, 'I
shall be safe though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart' . . . the
Lord would not pardon him, but rather the anger of the Lord and his
jealousy would smoke against that man, and the curses written in this
book would settle upon him, and the Lord would blot out his name from
under heaven."
</p>      <p><span class="c1">
This is amazing, for is it because this person hears G-d's covenant that
he blesses himself in his heart? Should the Scripture not rather have
said "when he hears the words of this sworn covenant, he will not be
afraid"? Moreover, what is the reason for the great anger directed at
this person beyond that directed against other sinners? But according to
what has already been said, we can well understand the words of the
Scripture. For the Eternal established these covenants with the whole
congregation of Israel in order that they observe His ordinances and
keep His laws for the sake of the happiness and welfare of the nation.
If, therefore, a single individual should arise to do any sin or
transgression and he acts wickedly and says in his heart, even though
for the sake of the entire nation it would be very much desired that I
act uprightly and although the entire community is obligated to do
justice and righteousness to ensure the national welfare, nevertheless,
I, myself, will transgress the law to do whatever is right in my own
eyes, because my private conduct will not cause the ties of the
community to break or its foundations to collapse. It is in this way
that the person blesses himself in his heart, because he thinks that if
he alone walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, he will be safe and
no ill will befall him. That is why the anger of the Lord will burn and
He will pour His wrath on this person. For if he removes himself from
the community, then so will his neighbor, and the nation will collapse
on her foundations and her pillars will tumble. That is why the Eternal
will be enraged and will smite him sevenfold for his transgressions and
will settle upon him all the curses measure for measure.
</p>      <p><span class="c1">
Let us now return to what we said above. A person of dear spirit and
good heart who loves every man as he loves himself will find a great
incentive to fulfill the entire Torah for the sake of the nation as a
whole. He will not exclude himself from the community, because he loves
the community as much as he loves himself. He will therefore take care
to do what is good and upright even with no expectation of reward after
his death when he will ascend to the mountain of the Eternal and will
rise up to His holy place. These are the beautiful words that Hillel
told the Gentile:
</p>      <p><span class="c1">
What is hateful unto you, do not do to your neighbor. This is the great
principle of the Torah and in this you will find an explanation for all
the ordinances while standing on one foot here in this world. And the
rest [by which he meant, reward and punishment in the eternal world] is
not explained clearly. It is only commentary (פירושא הוא) that you may
infer from punishment of "being cut off" (כרת) and from many other
Scriptural derivations. Go and study and you will understand.
