Our Master explained that here we find a correct indication for the
custom that whoever discourses publicly and offers words of moral
instruction (מוסר) should preface his discourse with words of halakhah
before speaking words of aggadah and reproof. For the word "וַיֵּלֶךְ"
(and he went) refers to law (הלכה) because halakhot are the paths of
understanding. Thus, only after he went (וַיֵּלֶךְ) did Moses speak all
these words (וַיְדַבֵּר אֶת הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה), which were words
of moral instruction. The reason for prefacing words of reproof and
moral instruction with words of הלכה is based on what R. Akiva said:
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
I wonder if anyone in this generation is capable of offering reproof,
because should he say: "take the splinter from between your teeth," they
will respond: "take the beam from between your eyes" (in other words
they will respond that the one who gives reproof is guilty of sins at
least as bad as the sins committed by those to whom he is giving reproof).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, if the one giving reproof is a scholar (תלמיד חכם) they
cannot mention his sins, because the Sages say that if you see that a
scholar has transgressed at night, do not suspect him of being a sinner
the following day, because he has surely repented. And because a custom
of Israel is legally binding (מנהג ישראל תורה) and emanates from a
holy source, anyone who offers reproof should begin by speaking words of
הלכה to show that he is a scholar. Thus, even if his audience may
know of some misconduct on his part, they will assume that, being a
scholar, he has repented of that misconduct, and they therefore will
listen attentively to his reproof.

It is written in the Midrash Tanhuma:
Moses said: "Master of the Universe, I praised you with the word "הֵן"
as it is written (Deuteronomy 10:14): 'Behold the heaven and the heaven
of heaven belong to the Lord your G-d' 
(הֵן לַה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ הַשָּׁמַיִם וּשְׁמֵי הַשָּׁמָיִם). Yet with the word "הֵן" You decree
death upon me? The Holy One Blessed Be He replied to him: "A bad
neighbor sees the gain but not the cost. Don't you remember that when I
sent you to redeem them from Egypt you said to Me (Exodus 4:1): "behold,
they will not believe me' (וְהֵן לֹא-יַאֲמִינוּ לִי). That is why "behold,
the days approach when you must die" (הֵן קָרְבוּ יָמֶיךָ לָמוּת).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And our master explained this Midrash with knowledge and understanding.
For the man who walked at the head of the people of Israel and led the
flock of Joseph had been charged with two tasks. The first was to stand
in the breach to abate the wrath and the anger when the Eternal became
incensed and would destroy them or would do evil to them, by atoning for
their sin with his prayers on their behalf and causing the Eternal to
repent of the evil that He had thought to do to them. This, indeed, is
what Moses the shepherd of Israel did when they despised the Almighty
and defied Him, causing the Eternal to become incensed against them. So
when the Eternal decided to kill them in the desert and destroy them,
Moses beseeched the Eternal to forgive their sin and to withdraw His
plan to do them evil. The second task of the leader was to lead them
along the path on which they should walk and to reproach them
continually for their conduct, to correct their traits, to cause them to
reverence the Eternal and to love Him.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Jethro admonished Moses about both of these responsibilities when he
said to him (Exodus 18:19): "you shall represent the people before G-d."
Rashi comments:
you shall be an agent and an advocate between them and the Omnipresent
who will pray for them and will offer numerous supplications before G-d
and will speak well of them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And also this (Exodus 18:20):
and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them
know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However if we reflect upon these two tasks, we shall see that they are
at cross purposes to each other, so that whenever one becomes more
prominent, the other must recede correspondingly. For only a man so
exalted that he could ascend the ladder that rises to the house of the
Almighty on high, who could set his dwelling place among the stars,
would have the courage to approach before the Eternal to quell His
burning wrath. And as the soul of this person ascends and soars toward
the Eternal, his courage would increase correspondingly, so that his
strength and dignity would enable him to stand as an iron pillar of
defense so that the Eternal might not pour His wrath upon them. However,
as he ascends, his words no longer draw the hearts of his listeners
toward him and they will not listen to his reproof. Nor will they learn
from his example, as they will say: "What have we to do with him, is he
not so very far removed from us?" For one who gives reproof to the
people will not strike the chords in the heart of his audience unless he
is similar to them, is acquainted with their concerns and knows what
they are seeking. Only then, can one administer an appropriate reproof.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is clear from what the Eternal told Moses when he ascended on high
to receive the two tablets of the covenant from the Eternal (Exodus
32:7): "Go down; for your people . . . have corrupted themselves." And
the Sages interpreted this to mean: "Go down from your greatness." In
other words: "You must lower yourself to become closer to them. Only
then will it be within your power to lead them in the paths of honesty
and righteousness." At the exalted level at which Moses then stood, the
people would not listen to him or turn an attentive ear to his words.
However, how could a man whose soul had not soared and was just like one
of the people stand in the breach to beseech and supplicate the Eternal
to abate His anger and abandon His wrath, and by virtue of what merit
could he cry out to the Eternal?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Moses tried with all his might to perform both these tasks
wholeheartedly. When he came down a second time from the mountain where
G-d and truth had been revealed to him, he had become so great that his
face shone. Moses therefore put a veil over his face to hide his face
from the people, so that they should not understand how wondrous were
his ways and would continue to accept instruction from him. But when he
came before the Eternal to beg and supplicate for his people, he removed
the veil and his honor was completely revealed in its glory and
brilliance. And for his sake, the Eternal forgave them. However, at the
end of his days, Moses became very much greater; his brow rose to the
clouds and his head to the heavens, so that he was just short of an
angel. He could no longer conceal his magnificence and his greatness
from the people, for every eye that glimpsed him and everyone that saw
him recognized the splendor of his greatness which was enormous. It was
no longer in his power to control his people and to teach the wayward
understanding for his voice was no longer heard. That is why the end of
all flesh came upon him and his sun began to set while the spirit of the
Eternal began to move his servant Joshua whose sun began to rise.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now in the Midrash Tanhuma it is said about the verse (Numbers 23:9):
"lo, a people dwelling alone" (הֶן עָם לְבָדָד יִשְׁכֹּן), that the
letters "ה" and "נ" have no numerical mates. In other words, the
letter "ה" with a numerical value of five is added to itself to equal
ten and the letter "נ" with a numerical value of fifty is added to
itself to equal one hundred, whereas all the other letters must be added
to a different letter to equal either ten or one hundred. That is why
the word "הֵן" (lo) is used in this context to signify that the people
dwells alone as do the letters "ה" and "נ".
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The words of the Midrash with which we began now shine forth as does the
light of the sky. For the Eternal said to Moses: "Behold, the days
approach when you must die" (הֵן קָרְבוּ יָמֶיךָ לָמוּת), because you are
now in the category of "הֵן" In other words, you have been set apart,
because you have become so great and the distance between you and the
people is so vast that you cannot associate with them and be close to
them. That is why the day of your death is approaching and your position
must be given to another who is popular with the multitude of his
brethren. Moses then asked with an agitated heart,
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Master of the Universe, with the word "hein" I praised you. Do you now
decree death upon me with the word "hein"? Am I not preeminent because,
having ascended on high and wrestled mightily with G-d, I was exalted
over all other human beings? Did I not become an interlocutor on behalf
of Your people to cause Your wrath to recede so that You spared them for
my sake? Did I not praise You with "הֵן" (as it is written): "Behold
the heaven and the heaven of heaven belong to the Lord your G-d" 
(הֵן לַה' הַשָּׁמַיִם וּשְׁמֵי הַשָּׁמַיִם) because You are separated
from all the inhabitants of the earth and Your path is in heaven. So who
can, better than I, ascend to You and come to the inner sanctum? (As,
indeed, it is written in the Midrash that when Moses was prepared to die
and entrusted his soul to the G-d of spirits, the Eternal roared like a
lion (Psalms 94:16): "Who rises up for Me against the wicked?" Who will
stand with Me in My time of trouble?)
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Then the trustworthy G-d answered him:
A bad neighbor sees the gain but not the cost. He sees only the crop of
his neighbor but not his neighbor's expenditures. So do you see only
what is on high and your own advantage, but not the great loss that
results, because you can no longer reprove the people, and they will not
listen to your words any more. Did you not say "behold the people of
Israel have not listened to me"? And wasn't this because you were
greatly separated from them and their ways were not your ways, so that
you could not reprove them and keep them from rejecting your words? That
is why they would not turn to listen you. Therefore, "behold, the days
approach when you must die" - when someone else who will be able to lead
them in righteousness and justice and to whose words of reproof they
will listen, will take your place.

הַקְהֵל אֶת הָעָם הָאֲנָשִׁים וְהַנָּשִׁים וְהַטַּף 
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> 
Assemble the people, men, women and little ones 
</span> (Deuteronomy 31:12)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
The Sages ask in the Talmud (Hagigah 3a): "Why did the little ones have
to come?" And they answer "in order to grant reward to those that bring
them." And it is an amazing wonder that the Eternal would command
something for no purpose other than to provide a reward for those who
perform the commandment. Moreover, the Scripture contradicts the words
of the Gemara by saying (Deuteronomy 31:13): "and that their children,
who have not known it, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your G-d."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It appears to our master that the words of the Sages and the words of
the Scripture do in fact coincide, because the Sages said that listening
to the holy words and the pure sayings will sanctify the thoughts of a
child and will inculcate the proper spirit within him making it easy for
him to understand wisdom and knowledge when he grows up. The Sages
recount that R. Jose, when he was just an infant, was brought by his
mother to the house of study. He was so inspired as a result that the
Sages of his generation said about him "fortunate is she who bore him."
That is the reward that the parents obtain for their effort, because
when their children grow up and they begin to teach them from books
about belief and understanding and they lead them beside still waters,
the children, whose hearts have already been prepared in their youth,
will quickly grasp the path of life, the Torah. This is what the Sages
meant when they said that the commandment of "הַקְהֵל" was given to
provide a reward to those who bring the children. The reward is at hand,
because through the performance of this commandment, the children will
be prepared to receive Torah and purity.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is also the meaning of the Scripture, for one may ask why it is
written first (Deuteronomy 31:12): "that they may hear and learn to fear
the Lord your G-d" (לְמַעַן יִשְׁמְעוּ וּלְמַעַן יִלְמְדוּ וְיָרְאוּ אֶת ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם), 
and then (31:13) concerning the children, it says
"may hear and learn to fear the Lord your G-d" (יִשְׁמְעוּ וְלָמְדוּ לְיִרְאָה,
אֶת ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם). But according to what has been said we
can well understand that, for the adults, listening is understanding. He
therefore said "לְמַעַן יִשְׁמְעוּ וּלְמַעַן יִלְמְדוּ". The parents should
themselves listen and understand the Torah according to its plain
meaning, for study leads to action, i.e., "to reverence the Lord your
G-d." But concerning the children, listening denotes only the activity
of hearing without study or understanding. Nevertheless, the activity of
listening will later cause them to learn to reverence G-d, because the
sound of the words of the Torah that they hear when they are young will
later inspire them to reverence. That is why the Scripture says that
they should simply hear the words as written. As a result of hearing the
words they will learn to be reverent even if they did not understand
what they heard. This reverence will prepare their hearts to understand
when they become adults, and they will fear the Eternal all their days.
This is the reward granted to those who bring them to hear the reading
of the Torah.
