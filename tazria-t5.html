R. Simlai said (Leviticus Rabbah 14:1): Even as man's creation was after
that of cattle, beasts and birds, even so the law concerning him comes
after that concerning cattle, beasts and birds.

In explaining this comment, our master repeated by way of introduction
what he had heard in the name of the gaon R. Shlomo Kvetsch explaining
Rashi's comment on the verse (Genesis 1:11): "Let the earth put forth
grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind"
(תַּדְשֵׁא הָאָרֶץ דֶּשֶׁא עֵשֶׂב מַזְרִיעַ זֶרַע עֵץ פְּרִי עֹשֶׂה פְּרִי לְמִינוֹ). Rashi comments:
that the taste of the tree be exactly the same as that of the fruit. It
did not, however, do this, but (Genesis 1:12) "the earth brought forth .
. . a tree yielding fruit" (וַתּוֹצֵא הָאָרֶץ . . . עֵץ עֹשֶׂה פְּרִי) and
the tree itself was not a fruit; therefore when Adam was cursed on
account of his sin, the earth was also visited (because of its sin) and
was cursed also [as it is written (Genesis 3:17): "cursed is the ground
for your sake" (אֲרוּרָה הָאֲדָמָה, בַּעֲבוּרֶךָ)].
 </span></p><p><span class="c1">
R. Kvetsch explained that, in order to weaken the power of the earth
from which man was taken, the Eternal created the earth and its fullness
before He created man, thereby transferring some of its power to the
trees and to the creeping things before man's creation. The full power
of the earth would thus not be implanted in man so that it would not be
too difficult for man to control his physical nature and to master his
evil inclination. Now if the earth had obeyed the command of G-d to
bring forth a fruit tree whose taste was like the taste of its fruit,
the earthly matter would have been further diluted, and perhaps then
Adam would not have sinned. When the Eternal visited punishment on Adam
for his sin, He therefore also visited punishment on the land for its
sin, inasmuch as Adam's sin occurred by way of what the earth had done.
 </span></p><p><span class="c1">
(Our master used this idea to explain the words of the Scripture
(Genesis 3:8): "and the man and his wife hid themselves from the Lord
G-d amongst the trees of the garden" 
(וַיִּתְחַבֵּא הָאָדָם וְאִשְׁתּוֹ מִפְּנֵי יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים בְּתוֹךְ עֵץ הַגָּן). 
This meant that Adam wanted to
roll off the guilt from himself by saying that if only the trees had
tasted like the fruit he would not have sinned.)
 </span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now just as the Eternal formed man in wisdom and understanding to
fashion him from a pure and untainted material to minimize and weaken
the power of carnal desire, so also must man act wondrously in
performing the G-dly deed of begetting children in his own image and his
own form to perpetuate his kind. To do so, he must guard his soul
against any impure food that may not be eaten so that his own
constitution will remain clean and pure. And if he does so, holy and
splendid offspring will issue from him. But if he makes himself impure
in all these matters, his constitution will become tainted and he will
beget a wild ass of a man (ופרא אדם), ruddy (אדמוני), and eager to shed
blood.
 </span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is precisely what R. Simlai meant to say: "Even as man's creation
was after that of cattle, beasts and birds, even so the law concerning
him comes after that concerning cattle, beasts and birds." For man, too,
is a creator and a fashioner of forms, and he, too, is obligated to
prepare a pure material and to refine his ingredients so that a lovely
shoot, a delightful seedling, shall come forth from his stock. And how
shall he purify his matter so that it should have no propensity for
evil, if not by means of the food that he eats which constantly
replenishes his flesh and blood that melt away?
  </span></p><p><span class="c1">
Our master also used this idea to explain the Midrash (Leviticus Rabbah
14:1) which says here:
the verse "if a woman conceives" refers to that which is written (Psalms
139:5): "Thou hast beset [formed] me behind and before" 
(אָחוֹר וָקֶדֶם צַרְתָּנִי). . . . If man acts meritoriously, they say to him: "You
preceded all the works of creation;" but if not, they say to him: "A
gnat preceded you, a snail preceded you."
 </span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Midrash tells us that if a man acts meritoriously, we say to him
that he is more elevated than any of the other creatures that were
created before him, because he was created last and the matter from
which he was fashioned was thus better and more pleasing than the matter
from which the other creatures were formed. However, if he is not
meritorious, and he has walked in the stubbornness of his heart, we say
to him: "Look, even the gnat preceded you, and it was created by G-d
before you desecrated the power of the earth from which you were
created. Yet all this did no good for you, because you followed your
evil inclination."
 </span></p><p><span class="c1">
How well did our master explain in this way the text of the blessing
which we say upon performing a circumcision: "who didst sanctify the
beloved from birth, impressing Thy statute in his flesh and marking his
descendants with the sign of the holy covenant" 
(אשר קידש ידיד מבטן וחוק בשארו שם וצאצאיו חתם באות ברית קודש).
For according to the above, the first condition for a person's offspring
to be holy is that he consume only permitted food. In addition, one must
also obey the laws of family purity (חוק נדות) which are recorded in
this poroshah. And then finally, on the eighth day, the flesh of his
foreskin shall be circumcised in order, as the Rambam wrote, to weaken
the carnal desire. This is what is meant by the words of the blessing.
"אשר קידש ידיד מבטן" refers to the food that one eats that
fills his stomach, thereby sanctifying the child with the commandment
relating to the stomach, as it is written (Proverbs (13:25): "The
righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the
wicked suffers want" 
(צַדִּיק אֹכֵל לְשֹׂבַע נַפְשׁוֹ וּבֶטֶן רְשָׁעִים תֶּחְסָר). 
And then "חוק בשארו שם" is a reference to
the laws of family purity (חוק נדות), for G-d established a fixed cycle
for women. And "ושאר" (flesh) is also a reference to the woman as the
Sages understood the verse (Leviticus 21:2) "except for his nearest of
kin" (כִּי אִם לִשְׁאֵרוֹ כִּי הַקָּרֹב אֵלָיו) as a reference to his wife. And
finally after observing all these laws, one is commanded "to mark his
descendants with the sign of the holy covenant" (וצאצאיו חתם באות
ברית קודש), because it is also necessary to circumcise the
foreskin in order to weaken the carnal desire.
