In the Midrash (תנא דבי אליהו רבה) it is written that at the moment
that Israel said (Exodus 24:7) "we will do and obey" (na'aseh
v'nishma), the Holy One Blessed Be He immediately said that they
should bring for Him an offering. And it appears to our master that
this is based on what is said in the Midrash Rabbah (Exodus 42.8) for
Ki Tisa:
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
R. Meir said: It was not even one complete day [before they sinned], for
while they were yet standing near Sinai, exclaiming "We will do, and
obey," their hearts were already concentrated on idolatry (כשאמרו
ישראל נַעֲשֶׂה וְנִשְׁמָע מיד הרהרו ע"ז בלבם), for
it says (Psalms 78:36): But they flattered Him with their mouth, and
lied to Him with their tongue (וַיְפַתּוּהוּ בְּפִיהֶם וּבִלְשׁוֹנָם יְכַזְּבוּ לוֹ).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And our master has explained at length elsewhere that R. Meir follows
his general opinion which is that the first expression dominates 
(תפוס לשון ראשון). 
Thus, when they uttered the word "נַעֲשֶׂה" (we will do)
before they said "nishma" (נִשְׁמָע), i.e. understand, they showed
that they wanted to perform an action before they would study and
understand, because they despised study. For the reason that they
committed the sin of the calf was that they refused to study in order
that they themselves would understand the actions that they were
obligated to do. That is why they asked (Exodus 32:1) for "G-ds, which
shall go before us" (עֲשֵׂה לָנוּ אֱלֹהִים אֲשֶׁר יֵלְכוּ לְפָנֵינוּ) - so
that, like a beast in the field, they could go and follow him without
understanding or reflection. Thus, in saying "נַעֲשֶׂה" before saying
"נִשְׁמָע", they exposed the vacuous idea that led to the sin of the calf.
And had they not committed that transgression, it would never have been
necessary for them to build the Tabernacle or to bring sacrifices, as we
have written above (Seder Bo). Thus, the Midrash says that as soon as
they said "נַעֲשֶׂה וְנִשְׁמָע" the Holy One Blessed Be He commanded them
to take for Him an offering, which is derived from the connection
between those words and the sin of the calf and the connection between
the sin of the calf and the building of the Tabernacle. [See Seder Ki
Tisa for further elaboration of this idea.]

That they bring for me an offering, from every man whose
heart makes him willing you shall take my offering. 
</span> (Exodus 25:2)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
It may be asked why the words tikhu t'rumati (you shall take my
offering) are repeated after the words "v'yikhu li t'rumah" (they shall
bring for me an offering). And our master said something extraordinary
about this. Rashi explains that the words "v'yikhu li t'rumah" mean that
the offering should be taken "li-sh'mi" for My name. The later
commentators explain that this is meant to teach that whatever charity
and kindness a person does should be done for the sake of the Eternal
alone Who commanded him to do so, rather than because his heart impelled
him to do so and inspired him to do good and charitable deeds. For the
good-hearted person, who opens his hand to everyone who asks without
distinguishing between the deserving and the undeserving, will
frequently waste his money on a person who is unworthy of charity, which
is not good in the sight of G-d. So the best counsel for the person with
a heart of flesh who lacks any constraint on his inclination to give to
everyone with an outstretched hand is to give charity to an agent who
collects funds that will be used for the sake of G-d and who will
disburse them to the deserving poor that follow the path of the Divine
Torah. That is why the Scripture says "v'yikhu li" (i.e., for My name) -
to teach that those who give their money in the name of G-d (i.e., only
to those who are deserving) may give the offering themselves. However
from those whose heart impels them to give their money to anyone who
asks them - from these you should take the money and distribute it
appropriately only to those who are deserving.
