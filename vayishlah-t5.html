  I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now (Genesis 32:5)

  Rashi comments on this passage: "I have fulfilled the 613 (תרי"ג)
  commandments." And many have asked, but Jacob did not fulfill the
  commandment of honoring his father and mother, and was, in fact,
  punished for not doing so. And if so, he did not reach the total of
  613.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  And our master says that, by saying "and I stayed until now"
  (וָאֵחַר עַד עָתָּה), Jacob actually meant to exclude the commandment
  of honoring his father and mother from the total of 613, for what he
  meant to say was "I fulfilled the 613 commandments except for my
  having stayed until now by which I negated the commandment of
  honoring father and mother." But his further mention of having oxen
  (וַיְהִי לִי שׁוֹר), which is also a reference to the incident with
  Joseph who is called an ox, and to having asses (חֲמוֹר), which is
  also a reference to Shehem the son of Hamor, who tormented Dinah
  indicates that Jacob understood that he was destined to be punished
  for not fulfilling that commandment. Because he would be punished in
  another way for not fulfilling the commandment of honoring father
  and mother, Jacob could say that he had no reason to be afraid of
  Esau.

  וַתִּגַּשְׁןָ הַשְּׁפָחוֹת הֵנָּה וְיַלְדֵיהֶן וַתִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶיןָ וַתִּגַּשׁ גַּם לֵאָה 
                   וִילָדֶיהָ וַיִּשְׁתַּחֲווּ וְאַחַר נִגַּשׁ יוֹסֵף וְרָחֵל וַיִּשְׁתַּחֲווּ

 Then the maidservants came near, they and
  their children, and they bowed down. And Leah also with her children
  came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and
  Rachel, and they bowed down. (Genesis 33:6-7) 
  </span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  Our master explained that the feminine verb form of "bowed down"
  (וַתִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶיןָ) is used with the maidservants, because there were
  two of them (Bilhah and Zilpah), so the corresponding verb had to be
  plural. The Scripture therefore treated them, not the children, as
  the principal subjects of the verb and formed the verb accordingly.
  But it was not possible to use a plural form of the verb with Leah
  as the subject, so a plural form of the verb required her six
  children to be included in the subject. The Scripture therefore
  treated the children as the principal subjects of the verb and used
  a corresponding masculine verb form. However, since Joseph and
  Rachel were separate, the Scripture could have used the feminine
  verb form (וַתִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶיןָ), because the Matriarchs properly take
  precedence over the children. Nevertheless, the Scripture chose the
  masculine form (וַתִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶיןָ) because Joseph approached Esau ahead
  of his mother, because, as Rashi explains, he said "my mother is a
  beautiful woman; so that the wicked man will not set his fancy on
  her, I will stand in front of her and prevent him from gazing at
  her." For that reason the Scripture uses the masculine form to make
  Joseph the principal subject.

And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, . . . and he camped
  before the city. (Genesis 33:18)  

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  The Sages comment in the Talmud (Shabbat 33) that the word "שלם"
  (complete) indicates that Jacob established bathhouses for them, he
  established marketplaces for them, and he established a coinage for
  them. And the Shalah ha-qadosh wrote that in mentioning these three
  ways in which Jacob brought about perfection, the Gemara was
  indicating the three ways in which a person must perfect himself:
  perfection of the body, i.e, his actions; perfection of his
  thinking, i.e., his study; and perfection of his property. Jacob our
  father came to Shehem, having perfected his actions in these three
  ways, and he taught the people how they could conduct themselves to
  achieve such perfection.
  
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  And it appears to our master that this may be explained based on the
  writings of the Sages of truth (חכמי האמת)  i.e., the
  Kabbalists, who say that if a righteous person derives benefit from
  any object, that object is perfected and achieves its desired
  purpose. Similarly if one makes something or repairs something to
  fulfill his own desires and that object is subsequently used by a
  righteous person for his own benefit, the person who made or
  repaired that object is perfected and has not toiled in vain. We may
  say, therefore, that the people of Shehem had already made
  bathhouses, marketplaces, and a coinage for themselves. But by
  deriving benefit from those things, Jacob did them a kindness,
  because whatever they had made was perfected on his account by his
  deriving benefit from those things.
