In the Midrash Tanhuma it is written:
This verse (Deuteronomy 26:16) bears on the verse (Psalms 95:6): "O,
come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our
Maker." Moses foresaw that the Holy Temple was destined to be destroyed
and that the offering of the first fruits was destined to be
interrupted, so he arose and decreed that they should pray three times
daily.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And it appears to our master that the Midrash correctly deduces from
this verse that prayer was instituted to substitute for the offering of
the first fruits, because prayer is a service of the heart 
(עבודה שהוא בלב). As the Sages say in the Talmud (Ta'anit 2a): "What is Service
of Heart? You must conclude, Prayer. " The verse must therefore be
explained as follows: "This day" (הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה) (referring to a time
when the Holy Temple is in existence) "the Lord your G-d commands you to
do these statutes and ordinances" (ה"א מְצַוְּךָ לַעֲשׂוֹת אֶת הַחֻקִּים הָאֵלֶּה וְאֶת
הַמִּשְׁפָּטִים), that is, the offering of the
first fruits and to the separation of the tithes that were just
mentioned (Deuteronomy 26:12). However, there will come a time when "you
shall be careful to do them with all your heart and all your soul"
(וְשָׁמַרְתָּ וְעָשִׂיתָ אוֹתָם בְּכָל לְבָבְךָ וּבְכָל נַפְשֶׁךָ), so that
you will be able attain your desires only through doing these
commandments by way of your heart and soul, that is, through prayer. And
this is suggested by what is written in the Midrash concerning the verse
above (Deuteronomy 26:15):
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
"Look down from Thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Thy people
Israel, and the ground which Thou hast given us" (הַשְׁקִיפָה מִמְּעוֹן קָדְשְׁךָ
מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם וּבָרֵךְ אֶת עַמְּךָ אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל וְאֵת הָאֲדָמָה אֲשֶׁר נָתַתָּה לָנוּ). Come and 
see how great are those who bring forth the
tithes, for every expression of "looking down" (השקפה) in the
Scriptures is for ill, but here it is for good. And one who brings forth
the tithe does not depart until he is receives the following promise:
"May you merit to bring forth the tithe again next year."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And Rashi quotes the Sifri on this verse:
"Look down from Thy holy habitation . . . and bless Thy people Israel:"
We have done what Thou hast laid upon us; do Thou now what lies upon
Thee to do, because Thou hast said (Leviticus 26:3-4): "If you walk in
My statutes and observe My commandments and do them, then I will give
you rains in their season and the land shall yield its increase and the
trees of the field shall yield their fruit."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
From here it is clearly evident that those who brought forth the first
fruits to the Holy Temple did not come mournfully and did not speak
beseechingly, like indigent persons begging for a gratuitous gift.
Rather they demanded what was theirs under the law. And they did so
based on what the Sages said concerning the verse (Malachi 3:10): "And
thereby put Me to the test, says the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open
the windows of heaven for you and pour out an overflowing blessing" -
that it is forbidden to test the Eternal except in connection with
giving tithes. It was therefore proper to say: "this day you may demand
under the law your share without supplication." But Moses foresaw that
the Holy Temple would be destroyed and the bringing of the first fruits
would be suspended, so that they would no longer be able to demand their
share with an upraised hand. He therefore arose and decreed that they
should pray three times daily like a poor person who asks and pleads at
the doorway, not like those who brought the tithes who did not beg for a
gratuitous favor from the Almighty, but instead said: "Look down from
Thy holy abode, from Heaven . . ."

In the Talmud (Megilah 10b) the Sages ask: "Now does the Holy One,
blessed be He, rejoice in the downfall of the wicked?" And the answer
that is given is that He Himself does not rejoice, rather He will make
others rejoice, because the verse uses the verb form "יָשִׂישׂ" rather than
"ישוש" However, we find the hiphil verb form "יָשִׂישׂ" elsewhere (Psalms
19:6): "Which comes forth like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and
like a strong man runs its course with joy" (כְּחָתָן יֹצֵא מֵחֻפָּתוֹ יָשִׂישׂ
כְּגִבּוֹר לָרוּץ אֹרַח). In that verse, too, the pa'al
verb form "ישוש" is not used, and certainly there we cannot understand
"יָשִׂישׂ" to mean that he will make others rejoice. And, as we know, there
are many instances where verbs are conjugated in the hiphil form, yet
they are not causative.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Were it not for the words of Hazal it would have appeared to our master
to answer their question as follows. The Holy One Blessed Be He does not
rejoice in the downfall of the wicked of the nations of the world,
because their downfall is absolute as it is written (Job 12:23): "He
makes nations great and destroys them." In other words (Psalms 55:24),
"He will cast them down to the lowest pit," and never will they live or
see light again. That is why the Eternal does not rejoice over the
downfall of these creations of His hands. But the Children of Israel
about whom it is said (Amos 5:2): "She has fallen, but never again,
arise, Virgin of Israel" (נָפְלָה לֹא תוֹסִיף קוּם בְּתוּלַת יִשְׂרָאֵל); and
it is also said (Leviticus 26:44): "Yet for all that, when they are in
the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor
them, so as to destroy them utterly and break My covenant with them."
For the Eternal will never wipe them out, and whatever "evil which He
thought to do to His people" was intended only to cause them to turn
away from their evil path, as it is written (Ezekiel 18:32): "so turn
and live" (שׁוּבוּ וִחְיוּ).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now the halakhah teaches us that one who tears down on the Sabbath in
order to build is culpable for performing constructive work on the
Sabbath, because the purpose of any activity is determined by the end
that is sought. And just as a true surgeon will rejoice to the utmost
when he cuts away dead flesh "like a loathed untimely birth" (Isaiah
14:19) in order to cure and restore the patient, so the Eternal rejoices
when He punishes us justly in order to cause us to return to Him. "The
Lord hath chastened us sorely; But He has not given us over to death"
(Psalms 118:18). And this He has promised in this terrifying rebuke:
"And as the Lord took delight in doing you good, and in multiplying you;
so the Lord will take delight in bringing ruin upon you and destroying
you." This means that He will not conduct Himself with us as He does
with the all the wicked of the nations in whose destruction He takes no
delight them since once they reach the grave they never arise again. But
with us He will take delight in administering His punishment to us. For
His longing is to cause us to return from our evil path so that He may
doing us good. And this is a comfort to Israel and a secure promise.

Rashi comments:
You will seek to be sold to them for slaves and handmaids. . . It would
not be correct to interpret v'hitmakartem in the sens of "and you will
be sold" (ונמכרתם), i.e., by sellers other than yourselves, because
it adds afterwards "but no one will buy you" (וְאֵין קֹנֶה).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
From his words it appears that Rashi would have interpreted
"והתמכרתם" as similar to "v'nimkartem" [i.e., as a nifal verb
rather than a hitpael verb] if the words "וְאֵין קֹנֶה" had not been
written. He therefore interpreted "והתמכרתם" as a hitpael verb
meaning that they will seek to be sold. And our master said that in the
Midrash "והתמכרתם" is in fact interpreted as a nifal verb meaning
that you will be sold. And the words "וְאֵין קֹנֶה" he interprets as
meaning that there will be no one who will want to buy you. His view in
offering this interpretation was that the children of Israel are the
offspring of kings, leaders and aristocrats, and therefore could never
sink to the lowest level to become a humiliated slave or a disgraced
maidservant. And even when they are in the land of their enemy and are
sold as slaves and maidservants, even then their grandeur will remain
and their countenance will not fall. On the contrary, they will rule
over their lords, because an enlightened servant will rule over a
disgraceful son, as is evident from Joseph who, when in the house of his
Egyptian lord, was appointed by him to manage his lord's house and
property. And even in the most difficult time for Joseph, when he was
incarcerated with the prisoners of war and affliction, he found favor in
the eyes of the prison warden who placed all the other prisoners under
his authority, because his appearance testified that his was not the way
of a slave, the son of an ignoble family.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Midrash therefore came to teach us not to explain the verse
literally. The words "וְאֵין קֹנֶה" do not mean that there are no buyers
that could buy them from those selling them, but rather that the buyers
who would buy them as slaves would recognize that they would not be
buying slaves and maidservants but masters - aristocratic, noble, and
gifted. The Midrash therefore further commented on the words 
"וְאֵין קֹנֶה" "there will be no one that can buy you" (אין מי שיקנה אתכם), 
as if to say that there will be no one about whom it could be
said that he bought you for slaves or maidservants, because this is not
your role and you are not fit to be sold as slaves and therefore will
not sold into slavery. And this, too, is a comfort.
