          Rashi comments:
          Because Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel,
          saying, "What
          is this command and what reason is there for it?" the
          Scripture
          therefore writes the term "חקה" (statute) about it, implying:
          it is an
          enactment from before Me, you have no right to think
          critically about it
          (להרהר אחריה).
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          Now one may ask, why do they taunt us only concerning the
          commandment of
          the red heifer? Are there not many other statutes besides this
          one? It
          is also difficult to understand why Rashi says you have no
          right to
          think critically about it (להרהר אחריה). What transgression
          would
          one commit if one did think critically about it?
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          And it appears to our master that an explanation can be
          deduced from the
          fact that the red heifer was, as we know, instituted to atone
          for the
          sin of the calf. (See what we have written concerning this in
          פרשת קרח.) So when Korah saw the chapter concerning the red
          heifer, he
          thought that as a result of the red heifer the sin of the calf
          would be
          completely forgiven and that the ultimate redemption (קץ
          הימין)
          about which it is said (Isaiah 25:8) "He will swallow up death
          forever"
          (בלע המות לנצח) would be attained. The Eternal will then save
          Israel forever, and bring eternal joy upon them. This implies
          that
          whoever can find "the words of delight" (דברי חפץ) by gaining
          an
          understanding of the commandment of the red heifer will also
          comprehend
          "the final wonders" (קץ הפלאות), because they are mutually
          interdependent. However, since the final wonders are a secret
          hidden
          from the sight of every living creature, and in the Talmud the
          Sages
          said "woe unto those who attempt to calculate the end of
          days," the
          Eternal closed up the commandment of the red heifer and
          allowed no one
          to think critically about it (l'harheir ahareha) in order to
          understand
          its essence. That is why Satan and the nations of the world
          taunt Israel
          by saying to them "what is the sense of this commandment?" By
          this they
          mean to say "when will saviors come up on Zion?" In this way
          they
          breathe forth lies (יפיחו על ישראל כזבים) about Israel - that
          their hope from
          the Eternal has been disappointed and "there is no salvation
          for him in
          G-d" (ואין לו ישועתה באלהים סלה), which is a form of verbal
          oppression. However, shall we not wait for him every day? And
          He will
          hasten it in its time.</span></p>

      <p><span class="c1">
          In the Midrash it is written:
          From here we know that the Holy One Blessed Be He informs the
          righteous
          of their death in order that they may bequeath their crowns to
          their
          children.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          And our master explained this according to the Midrash
          concerning the
          verse (Ecclesiastes 8:8): "neither has he authority over the
          day of
          death" (ואין שלטון ביום המות). And according to the Midrash
          that
          when one approaches the day of death he is brought down from
          his
          position of honor.
          Our master brought numerous proofs that these two Midrashim
          are related,
          and one of them is from Moses who, at first, had two trumpets
          that were
          sounded when all the congregation were to be assembled before
          him. But
          at the end of his life, the Scripture writes about him
          (Deuteronomy
          31:1) "And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel"
          (וַיֵּלֶךְ, מֹשֶׁה; וַיְדַבֵּר אֶת-הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה,
          אֶל-כָּל-יִשְׂרָאֵל), for he had
          to go to them for he had no power on the day of his death.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          But one may ask: Do the righteous not go from strength to
          strength,
          higher and higher, so do they not, at the end of their days,
          reach their
          pinnacle and their fulfillment? For we find in the words of
          the Midrash
          on the verse (Psalms 37:18): "the Lord knows the days of the
          blameless"
          ( יודע ה' ימי תמימים):
          As they are whole (תמימים), so their years are whole (תמימים)
          (Genesis
          Rabbah, 58:1)
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          If that is so, why should the honor of the righteous be
          diminished in
          the eyes of the people? However the Master of all that happens
          does this
          so that the children or the students of the righteous may
          later be able
          to occupy their position. For the children or students are
          still young
          and have not reached the level of their parents. And if the
          people were
          to recognize the great distance between the successor and his
          father or
          his teacher, they would not submit to the authority of the
          successor and
          would belittle him by saying: "how can this one save us, and
          what is he
          compared to his father or to his teacher?" The Eternal
          therefore
          withdraws the honor and the glory from the father before his
          death so
          that his son can easily occupy his position.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          This is why the Scripture writes "may Aaron be gathered" to
          indicate
          that his honor and glory will be gathered "to his people,"
          that is,
          before the people. Why? Because "he shall not come into the
          land which I
          have given unto the children of Israel." Instead "strip him of
          his
          garments and bring them upon Elazar his son," because Elazar
          his son
          will become the priest in his place. Thus, the honor of Aaron
          must be
          gathered before his death, so that the people will not
          understand how
          much greater the power of the father is than that of the son.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          This is
          why the Midrash properly deduces
          From here we learn that the Holy One Blessed Be He informs the
          righteous
          of their death.
          For the souls of the righteous know well that their end is
          coming,
          because they feel that they are ascending ever higher.
          Nevertheless,
          they see that in the eyes of the people their honor is
          diminished. And
          this is done so that their sons may inherit their
          crowns.&nbsp; ודו"ק כי הוא מתוק מדבש. </span></p>
