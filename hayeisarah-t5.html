    And Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years old (Genesis 23:1)
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  Rashi comments that the Scripture writes "shanah" (years) after
  "hundred" and "twenty" and "seven" to tell us that when Sarah was
  twenty years old, her beauty was like that of a seven-year old. Many
  have wondered about this comment since a woman is more beautiful
  when she is twenty than when she is seven. But our master explains
  this according to what some philosophers have written, which is that
  when a woman's beauty is so extraordinary that people are astonished
  by it, she does not arouse desire on the part of an observer,
  because his senses and feelings are so overwhelmed that he is unable
  to feel desire.
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  Now Sarah, our mother, possessed such overwhelming beauty. (See
  Megilah 22 and the Maharshah there). Yet Avraham, our father, did
  not grasp the full extent of his wife's beauty. Still, he was
  concerned and said (Genesis 12:11-12): "Behold now, I know that you
  are a woman beautiful to behold. and when the Egyptians see you,
  they will say, 'This is his wife;' then they will kill me, but they
  will let you live." (הִנֵּה נָא יָדַעְתִּי כִּי אִשָּׁה יְפַת-מַרְאֶה אָתְּ יב וְהָיָה כִּי 
  יִרְאוּ אֹתָךְ הַמִּצְרִים וְאָמְרוּ אִשְׁתּוֹ זֹאת וְהָרְגוּ אֹתִי וְאֹתָךְ יְחַיּוּ) 
  But the Scripture tells us that when Avraham came to Egypt,
  "the Egyptians saw that she was very beautiful" (וַיִּרְאוּ הַמִּצְרִים אֶת
  הָאִשָּׁה כִּי יָפָה הִוא מְאֹד) which means that, contrary to
  Avraham's opinion that she was beautiful, but not extraordinarily
  so, her beauty did, indeed, surpass that of other women. The
  Egyptians, therefore, did not, as Avraham had feared, respond to her
  at all, they merely remarked on her exceptional beauty. The
  Scripture makes a further point: "And when the princes of Pharaoh
  saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh" (יִּרְאוּ אֹתָהּ שָׂרֵי פַרְעֹה וַיְהַלְלוּ
  אֹתָהּ אֶל פַּרְעֹה) which means that even the princes of
  Pharaoh did not, owing to her exceptional beauty, desire her for
  themselves. Instead, they praised her to Pharaoh, which, as Rashi
  explains, means that they praised her among themselves as one who
  was fit for the king. We know also that in their eyes the king was a
  deity not an ordinary human being, as Pharaoh said, "the river is
  mine and I have made it." Thus, the princes said that a woman such
  as this is fit only for a divine king, but not for ordinary human
  beings like us.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;">
	 <p><span class="c1">

This explains why the Torah compares Sarah's beauty at the age of
  twenty to that of a seven-year old. Even as a seven-year old does
  not arouse physical desire, similarly Sarah, when she was twenty,
  did not, owing to her exceptionally great beauty, arouse physical
  desire.

  Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed,
  taking all the goodly things of his master in his hand, and he arose
  and went to Mesopatamia (Genesis 24:10)
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  It may be asked why was "וַיֵּלֶךְ" (he went) written twice. It seems to
  our master that this may be explained according to the aggadic
  interpretation of the verse that the earth leapt for Eliezer (i.e.,
  his journey was miraculously shortened). Eliezer must have used one
  of the holy names of G-d to achieve this miracle. Moreover, just as
  the law prohibits one from deciding a question in the presence of
  his master, neither may one use any of the names in the presence of
  his master. The holy Shalah of blessed memory wrote that "טוב" with
  a "חולם" denotes the revealed Torah while "טוב" with a "שורוק"
  denotes the esoteric Torah. This is why it is written: "Then the
  servant took ten of his master's camels, and departed; taking all
  the goods of his master in his hand, and he arose and went to
  Mesopatamia." He went as would have any traveler even though "all
  the goodly things" (כל טוב) of Avraham were in his hand, meaning
  that his master had turned over to him the secrets of the Torah. It
  would have been within Eliezer's power to mention one of the names
  of G-d while he was still in Avraham's presence. But he did not do
  so. Instead, he left Avraham just as he always did. Only after
  traveling some distance away from Avraham did Eliezer arise, which
  means that he rose up to his full height and uttered the name of
  G-d, whereupon he immediately arrived in Mesopatamia. And see below
  on the verse ואבא היום אל העין.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  Rashi comments that the written text is "אֻלַי" (to me) instead of
  "אוּלַי" (perhaps) from which we learn that Eliezer had a daughter
  whom he wished Yitzhak to marry. Avraham told Eliezer, "my son is
  blessed, and you are cursed, and one who is blessed may not marry
  one who is cursed." This is very problematic. First, shouldn't the
  inference that Eliezer had a daughter whom he wanted Yitzhak to
  marry have been drawn from the passage recounting Eliezer's actual
  conversation with Avraham? Why should the inference have been drawn
  from the conversation in the house of Lavan? Second, how do we know
  how Avraham responded to Eliezer? Third, why when the Scripture
  recounts his conversation with Avraham does Eliezer say, "the woman
  will not want to go" (לֹא תֹאבֶה הָאִשָּׁה לָלֶכֶת) but in his conversation
  with Lavan, Eliezer says "the woman will not go" (לֹא תֵלֵךְ הָאִשָּׁה)?
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  In the book אפיקי יהודה, an answer is proposed to the first
  question. The author suggests that Eliezer's motives were hinted at
  when Eliezer said "perhaps (אוּלַי) the woman will not want to go."
  The word "אוּלַי" always indicates "הלואי" (may it be that) as our
  Sages explained in connection with the verse (Job 1:5): "It may be
  that my sons have sinned" (אולי חטאו בני). For whenever one does not
  wish the contingent event to occur the word "lest" (פן) is used as
  in: "lest your heart be deceived" (פן יפתה לבבכם) (Deuteronomy
  11:16); "and lest you lift up your eyes" (פן תשא עיניך) (Deuteronomy
  4:19) and the like. This observation is correct, but it only
  reinforces the question why Rashi did not base his comment about
  Eliezer on the earlier verse "perhaps she will not want to go" 
  (אולי לא תאבה האשה ללכת) instead of this verse in which he recounted
  his conversation with Avraham to Lavan. So what does the word
  "אולי"/"אלי" used in the discussion with Lavan teach us?

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  The book אוהל יעקב takes a different approach and maintains that
  until Eliezer said in the house of Lavan "perhaps she will not come
  after me" his desire that Yitzhak should marry his daughter was
  never revealed. But in saying this to Lavan and Betueil, Eliezer
  disclosed his true wish, for what did Eliezer accomplish by
  recounting his earlier conversation with Avraham to the family of
  Rivkah? Was Eliezer not denigrating Yitzhak by even suggesting that
  there was any reason to fear that Rivkah might not want to follow
  him back to Canaan to marry Yitzhak? And Eliezer chose his words
  carefully. But this interpretation leads into an even greater
  conundrum, because in that case Avraham could not have known of
  Eliezer's wish that Yitzhak should marry his own daughter. The
  Scripture informs us of Eliezer's intention only by recounting to us
  that he told Lavan "perhaps (אוּלַי) she will not follow me." If so,
  how is it possible that Avraham spoke to him concerning a
  posסדsibility (a marriage between Yitzhak and Eliezer's daughter)
  which Avraham never knew or heard of? One might say that Eliezer
  must have had a prior conversation with Avraham about the
  possibility of Yitzhak marrying his daughter, which was when Avraham
  told Eliezer that one who is blessed may not marry one who is
  cursed. But in that case, why did Eliezer mention the subject to the
  family of Rivkah when he already knew that, even if Rivkah did not
  come back with him to marry Yitzhak, Avraham would not have allowed
  Eliezer's daughter to marry Yitzhak, but would, as Rashi says, have
  taken one of the daughters of Aner, Eshkol or Mamre as a bride for
  Yitzhak?

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  And it appears to our master that these two ideas may be joined
  together and explained as follows. When Eliezer said to Avraham
  "perhaps (אוּלַי) she will not want to follow me," (by which he meant:
  "may it be that she will not want to follow me"), instead of saying
  "lest (פֶן) she will not want to follow me," Avraham understood
  Eliezer's intention perfectly. If Avraham did not reply at all, so
  that Eliezer could still have harbored a hope that his daughter
  might marry Yitzhak, then Eliezer, had he wished to undermine the
  match between Yitzhak and Rivkah, would have changed his wording and
  said "lest (פֶן) she not want to follow me" instead of "perhaps
  (אוּלַי) she will not want to follow me." For the word "perhaps"
  (אוּלַי) would reveal his intention to Rivkah's family as well. It is
  therefore certain that Avraham had already told Eliezer that one who
  is blessed may not marry one who is cursed, so that Eliezer's hopes
  had already been disappointed. When speaking to Lavan and Betuel,
  Eliezer was thus attempting to heighten their desire for the match
  by informing them that he, too, had very much wanted his daughter to
  marry Yitzhak, but had been rebuffed by Avraham.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  The Scripture therefore writes "אולי/אלי" to indicate to us that
  Eliezer told the family of Rivkah in detail of his conversation with
  Avraham. Eliezer therefore had to tell them that Avraham did not
  want Yitzhak to marry his daughter, because Avraham considered
  himself and Yitzhak to be blessed. It was thus that Eliezer achieved
  his goal in gaining the consent of Rivkah's family to her marriage
  to Yitzhak. We can now also understand why Rashi based his comment
  on the second "אוּלַי" not the first one. For it is the second "אוּלַי"
  from which the reply of Avraham to Eliezer can be inferred. The
  first "אוּלַי" indicated only that Eliezer had a daughter of his own
  whom he wished Yitzhak to marry. This also explains well why Eliezer
  said to Avraham, "perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me"
  which suggests that there was reason to fear that she would not want
  to follow him. But in the house of Lavan he changed his wording and
  said, "perhaps the woman will not follow me," which means: "may it
  be that the woman will not follow me for some reason or other," but
  not that there was any reason why Rivkah would not want to go with
  him.

        וָאָבֹא הַיּוֹם אֶל הָעָיִן
</span></p><p><span class="c2">	

And I came this day to the well (Genesis 24:42)

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  Rashi comments: "Today I started on my journey and today I arrived
  here." Hence we may infer that the earth leapt for him (i.e., his
  journey was miraculously shortened). R. Aha said: "The ordinary
  conversation of the servants of the Patriarchs was more pleasing to
  G-d than the Torah (halakhic discourse) of their children, inasmuch
  as the chapter of Eliezer (the account of his journey) is repeated
  in the Torah (i.e., first in narrative form and then as part of
  Eliezer's conversation with the family of Rivkah) while many
  important principles of the Law are only inferred from nuances in
  the text."

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  Many have wondered why the remark of R. Aha was mentioned here since
  it appears to be unrelated to the comment that precedes it. Nor is
  it clear how Rashi inferred from the word "הַיּוֹם" (today) that
  Eliezer left Canaan and arrived in Haran in one day.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  And our master was able to provide a single answer to both
  questions. In the initial narrative, the Scripture told us how
  Eliezer went (Genesis 24:10): "He arose and he went" (ויקם וילך). It
  then immediately tells us (24:11) "and he made the camels kneel down
  outside the city by the well of water" ( ויברך הגמלים מחוץ לעיר אל
  באר המים), without telling us anything about his journey. But in his
  conversation with Rivkah's family, we find the opposite: Eliezer
  says nothing about his departure and mentions only his arrival. That
  suggests that the departure and the arrival were identical, that his
  departure was immediately followed by his arrival. How very
  appropriate therefore was the comment of the Sages that the
  departure and the arrival coincided because the mountains skipped
  like rams and the valleys like sheep. However, one could still
  maintain that the Scripture was just being terse, mentioning the
  departure in the original narrative and the arrival in the
  conversation at the house of Lavan, without intending to indicate
  that a miraculous shortening of the journey had occurred. That is
  why Rashi records the comment of R. Aha that the conversation of the
  servants of the Patriarchs was more pleasing to G-d than the
  halakhic discourses of their children. For this comment proves that
  the Scripture was not being terse, but recounted in full the events
  of Eliezer's journey twice. How then is it possible that the only
  events that Scripture would not have mentioned twice were his
  departure and his arrival? It must be, therefore, that the Scripture
  intended to teach us that Eliezer's journey was miraculously
  shortened.

      And Rebekah and her maids arose,

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  One may ask why it says: "and the servant took Rebekah" after the
  Scripture had already said that she and her servants followed the
  man. See the Ramban and the Ibn Ezra who tried to answer this
  question.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  And to our Master it appears that this can be explained from the
  inference from this verse drawn by the Talmud (Berahot 61a) that one
  should follow a lion rather than follow a woman. It is evident,
  therefore, that Eliezer did not want to follow Rivkah, but, instead,
  went ahead of her. However, he went ahead of her only until the
  agents of her family formally transferred custody of Rivkah to the
  agent of her husband (i.e., to Eliezer), for until that moment
  Rivkah was not yet considered to be Eliezer's mistress and he was
  not yet considered to be her servant. (See Ketubot 48b: "if her
  father's agents delivered her to her husband's agents, she passes
  under the authority of her husband.") But once the agents of the
  family left her, Rivkah became Eliezer's mistress and he her
  servant. After that transfer of custody, it would have been a breach
  of protocol for Eliezer to travel ahead of Rivkah. Eliezer therefore
  took Rivkah from among her retinue and placed her at his side. And
  if you look carefully you will see that before she was conveyed into
  Eliezer's custody, the Scripture refers to him as "the man" (אִישׁ)
  but afterwards it calls him "the servant" (עֶבֶד). That is why it is
  written "they followed the man" until her father's agents returned
  to Haran, when Eliezer was still considered a man rather than her
  servant. But after the agents of her family returned home, it says
  "the servant took Rivkah." Once Eliezer became Rivkah's servant, he
  took her to travel at his side.
