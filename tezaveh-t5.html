Rashi comments:
Clear - without dregs; as we learn in Menahot (86a) "he lets it ripen on
the top of the olive tree."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
See the Siphtei Hakhamim who observed that Rashi wanted to explain how
we found oil without dregs. And our master says that the Siftei Hakhamim
was not careful in reading Rashi, because, according to the Siphtei
Hakhamim, Rashi gave no answer. Furthermore, does the Scripture write
"without dregs?" Does it not rather write "pure" (זָךְ)? And pure oil is
readily available, so what would be the purpose in letting the olive
ripen on the top of the olive-tree. But our master says simply that the
word "pure" refers not to the oil, but to the olive. This is also shown
by the cantilation which separates "שֶׁמֶן" (oil) from "זַיִת זָךְ"
(pure olive). This is also shown by the word "כָּתִית" (beaten), which is
written afterwards, because this certainly refers to the olive and not
to the oil. Thus, if "זָךְ" referred to the oil, then the word "כָּתִית"
should have preceded "זָךְ". See the Ibn Ezra. Rashi therefore explained
that, as we learned in Menahot, there is a pure olive which ripens at
the top of the tree.

Rashi comments:
He must enkindle it until the flame ascends by itself
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Siphtei Hakhamim explains that he meant to exclude the possibility
that he would enkindle and leave before the flame has begun to ascend.
Here again, with all respect for his scholarship, the Siphtei Hakhamim
was not precise, for one who looks at the Talmud (Shabbat 20a) will see
that this verse came to be lenient, and that the High Priest need not
kindle the light entirely, but need kindle it only until the flame
begins to ascend on its own. See Rashi and Tosafot there. And the Talmud
deduces this because the Scripture writes "לְהַעֲלֹת" (to cause to
ascend) not "לַעֲלֹת" (to raise). And the Talmud (Shabbat 21a) also
makes this deduction and infers a stringency that wicks and oils that
may not be lit on the Sabbath may not be lit in the Temple, because they
require adjustment and tilting even after they have been lit. And this
deduction is derived from the verb "l'ha'alot" which means that it must
be lit until it ascends on its own. In other words, after being lit, the
lamp should require no further adjustment, but should burn by itself
throughout the night. But the requirement that he not kindle the flame
and then leave required no specific Scriptural basis, nor could it be
deduced from the verb "לְהַעֲלֹת". On the contrary, one could have
interpreted the verb "לְהַעֲלֹת" to mean precisely that it would have
been sufficient to kindle the flame immediately before the flame
ascended on its own.
