      <p><span class="c1"> In the Midrash (Genesis Rabbah Jacob's
          request of Joseph is explained to mean: "that the Egyptians
          not use me as a medium of redemption" for it is written
          (Exodus 13:13): "And every firstling of an ass you shall
          redeem with a lamb" (וְכָל פֶּטֶר חֲמֹר תִּפְדֶּה בְשֶׂה). The
          Egyptians are considered asses, as it is written (Ezekiel
          23:20): "whose flesh is as the flesh of asses" (בְּשַׂר
          חֲמוֹרִים בְּשָׂרָם) while I am considered a sheep, as it is
          written (Jeremiah 50:17): "Israel is a scattered sheep" (שֶׂה
          פְזוּרָה יִשְׂרָאֵל).
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> And it appears to our master to explain the
          Midrash in view of the danger that the character trait of
          kindliness presents to a person. Although this trait may lead
          a person to do good for others and to care for them, the trait
          may also lead a person to a forbidden desire to engage in
          immoral relationships and to consort with adulterers. For the
          source of kindliness is an uncontrollable impulse, which is
          why the Scripture writes (Leviticus 20:17) in reference to one
          of the forbidden relationships, "חֶסֶד הוּא" (it is a shameful
          thing). Now we, the Children of Israel, are kind and we are
          merciful ones who are descended from merciful ones.
          Nevertheless, we are very far removed from forbidden
          relationships, and we flee from them to the furthest possible
          extent as required by the Torah which is called Truth. This
          was the trait of Jacob, who took pride in saying about his
          first-born son (Genesis 49:3): "my might and the first-fruits
          of my strength" (כֹּחִי וְרֵאשִׁית אוֹנִי). However, the
          Egyptians were licentious and lusted after forbidden
          relationships. By the same token, they were also good-hearted
          and so full of kindness that the Scripture writes (Deuteronomy
          23:7): "You shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a
          sojourner in his land" (לֹא תְתַעֵב מִצְרִי כִּי גֵר הָיִיתָ
          בְאַרְצוֹ). This means that, despite his tendency to immoral
          conduct, we should not abhor an Egyptian totally, because he
          also has a good side, which is that he arose to save our
          fathers who were strangers in his land, which became their
          refuge in their time of distress.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> In making his request to Joseph, Jacob was in
          fear for his soul, because he understood that the Children of
          Israel and the Egyptians had a character trait in common,
          namely the trait of kindliness. He feared that perhaps the
          Children of Israel would also deviate from the path of truth,
          the trait of Jacob, and would become dissolute like the
          Egyptians. They might, G-d forbid, stumble and not be able to
          get up. Was it not, in fact, precisely because they avoided
          illicit relationships that they were saved from Egypt? This is
          what Jacob said to Joseph (Genesis 47:29) "and deal kindly and
          truthfully with me" (וְעָשִׂיתָ עִמָּדִי חֶסֶד וֶאֱמֶת) by
          which he meant to say: "perform kindness in a way that is
          consistent with the Torah which is truth." Jacob continued,
          "bury me not in Egypt" by which he meant "do not abandon my
          trait of faithfulness while you remain in Egypt by committing
          adultery as the Egyptians do. For then my hopes will be
          destroyed. How will we be different from them, because they
          are also as kind-hearted and generous as we?" This was the
          meaning of the words the Midrash attributes to Jacob.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> "That the Egyptians should not use me as a
          medium of redemption" - in other words, that they should not
          be able to say that the children of Israel are, as are they,
          adulterers. "Whose flesh is as the flesh of asses" - in other
          words, that the Egyptians are licentious. "And I am a sheep."
          The Midrash explains elsewhere that Israel is compared to a
          sheep, because just as the whole body of a lamb shakes if one
          of its limbs is touched, similarly if one Israelite is
          endangered then the whole people are aroused. This reflects
          their trait of kindness, which is easily awakened. However,
          they are also scattered, meaning that when it is necessary to
          remain aloof and detached, they have the self-control to
          withstand temptation, which is the trait of might (הגבורה) and
          restraint (והצימצום). Israel is therefore called a scattered
          lamb. But if they were just a lamb, then they could, G-d
          forbid, be exchanged for an ass, "for every firstling of an
          ass you shall redeem with a lamb" (וכל פטר חמור תפדה בשה). And
          then how would these (the Israelites) be different from these
          (the Egyptians)?

      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> חֶסֶד וֶאֱמֶת </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> Kindly and truly (Genesis 47:29)
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> Rashi comments: Kindness and truth: the
          kindness that is shown to the dead is the "kindness of truth"
          (חסד של אמת) since one cannot hope for any reward.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The Siftei Hakhamim writes that Rashi's
          reference to the kindness shown to the dead was not meant to
          imply that kindness to the living could not also be completely
          disinterested, but, in fact, any kindness done without the
          expectation of any reward could be called "kindness of truth"
          (חסד של אמת). For Eliezer also said to the family of Rivkah
          (Genesis 24:49) "And now if you will deal kindly and truly
          with my lord" (וְעַתָּה אִם יֶשְׁכֶם עֹשִׂים חֶסֶד וֶאֱמֶת אֶת
          אֲדֹנִי) when he asked them to give him Rivkah without
          compensation or any expectation of reward.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> It thus appears that Rashi's opinion is that
          the only act of true kindness is an act performed without
          expectation of any reward. But this is difficult because the
          Sages in Nedarim 83b deduce from the verse (Ecclesiastes 7:2)
          "And the living will lay it to heart" (וְהַחַי יִתֵּן אֶל
          לִבּוֹ) that the living should bury and eulogize the dead so
          that they in turn will be buried and eulogized when they die.
          If so, the living do have some expectation of reward for their
          acts of mercy to the dead. Nor can one distinguish between
          whether the expectation is that the beneficiary of the act of
          kindness will reciprocate or that third-parties will
          reciprocate, because the one performing the act of kindness
          still expects to be rewarded in the end, so his kindness is
          not truly disinterested (חסד אמיתי). And even Joseph acted in
          this way when he requested that his brothers take his remains
          with them from Egypt.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> It therefore appears to our master that, but
          for the words of Rashi, we could have said the opposite: that
          kindness refers to any act done with no expectation of reward.
          But if an act is done in the expectation of reward, it is not
          kindness (חסד) but truth (אמת) that is done only for the sake
          of compensation. Jacob therefore told Joseph that the act of
          kindness that he was requesting from him was not an act of
          pure kindness, but also an act of truth, because Joseph would
          eventually also have to request from his brothers that they
          take his remains with them when they left Egypt. Joseph
          therefore performed an act of kindness, because he received no
          immediate compensation, but it also had an aspect of truth
          (אמת), because he hoped eventually to be compensated.
          Similarly, Eliezer, in saying, "if you will deal kindly and
          truly" with Abraham, meant that it would be a kindness to
          Abraham, because it was Abraham's desire that Isaac should
          marry a member of that family. But it was also "truth,"
          because what greater reward could they have than to be related
          by marriage to Abraham who has been blessed by G-d with
          everything.

      <p><span class="c2"> Benjamin is a ravenous wolf (Genesis 49:27):
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> Rashi comments: He (Benjamin) is a wolf that
          will tear. He prophesied that the descendants of Benjamin will
          be rapacious in the future, for they were told as it is
          written (Judges 21:21) "and seize each man his wife"
          (וַחֲטַפְתֶּם לָכֶם אִישׁ אִשְׁתּוֹ) after the incident of the
          concubine of Gibeah.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The Siftei Hakhamim writes that "יִטְרָף" is
          not an adjective modifying "wolf" (i.e., "a wolf that tears"),
          because every wolf tears. Rather it is a verb "יִטְרָף" whose
          subject is Binyamin. So the opinion of Rashi is that Benjamin
          is a wolf that will tear. And the Siftei Hakhamim should have
          elaborated further to say that if "יִטְרָף" were an adjective,
          the text would have been written in the present tense (טורף)
          not in the future tense (יִטְרָף).
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> And our master observed that there is a
          wonderful symbolism in this verse, because we know that when
          the children of Israel gathered together after the incident of
          the concubine of Gibeah to formulate a plan to allow the four
          hundred men of Benjamin to take wives from the other tribes so
          that the tribe of Benjamin should not be completely
          annihilated, they decided to let them catch wives from the
          tribe of Ephraim. And the reason that they designated the
          tribe of Ephraim was that Ephraim was descended from Joseph
          the brother of Benjamin. But there was also a hidden reason
          for this, which is that Joseph had been supposed to have
          twelve sons like Jacob. But, as a result of being in Egypt, he
          only had two sons instead of twelve. But those sons were in a
          spiritual sense restored by Benjamin through the birth of his
          ten sons each of whom he named in memory of his Joseph, as is
          explained well in the Midrash and in the kabbalistic books
          (ספרי חן). It was a kind of יבום to name the son in memory of
          the dead brother. Therefore, just as Benjamin restored the
          loss of Joseph by naming his sons in Joseph's memory, so too
          at the time when the tribe of Benjamin was threatened with
          extinction, it was appropriate that he should claim his reward
          by catching wives from the tribe of Ephraim the son of Joseph.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> This is what Jacob meant in his holy spirit
          by saying, Benjamin is a wolf, because he snatched the ten
          souls from the void and returned them to a place of holiness
          in the name of his brother. What is more, the numerical value
          of זאב is ten! But in the future Binyamin will tear (יטרוף) in
          the incident of the concubine of Gibeah when he will receive
          his reward for what he did for Joseph.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> According to this, we can well understand the
          words of the אור החיים&nbsp; who wrote concerning the verse
          (Genesis 30:23-24): "and Rachel said, G-d has taken away my
          reproach. and she called his name Joseph saying May the Lord
          add to me another son" (אָסַף אֱלֹקִים אֶת חֶרְפָּתִי וַתִּקְרָא אֶת שְׁמוֹ 
	  יוֹסֵף לֵאמֹר יֹסֵף יְהוָה לִי בֵּן אַחֵר). And these are his words:
	  The letter aleph is composed of a vav and two
          yods. She took one yod from it, leaving one yod and one vav.
          That is why she called him Joseph and not Asaph. And the yod
          which she took from Joseph she gave to Binyamin, which is
          written with an extra yod.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> Rachel spoke correctly in saying that G-d had
          taken away her disgrace, because Joseph was destined to have
          twelve sons like Jacob. But then she saw through the holy
          spirit, that ten would be lost. She therefore took a yod from
          Asaph and hid it in the name of Benjamin. This is why the
          Scripture says, "And she called his name Joseph: and said, may
          the Lord add to me another son" who will recover the ten that
          were lost. </span></p>
