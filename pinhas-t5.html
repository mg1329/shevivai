 Rashi comments:
because the tribes spoke disparagingly of him, saying: "Have you seen
this grandson of Puti, the father of whose mother used to fatten calves
for idolatrous sacrifices? And he has dared to slay a prince of one of
the tribes of Israel!" Therefore the Scripture comes and connects his
genealogy with Aharon (Sanhedrin 82b).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
There is a famous question, which is that if he acted properly in being
jealous on behalf of his G-d, what difference does it make if he was
from an aristocratic family or from the lowliest among the people? For
is not small or great just a name? And if he acted basely by spilling
innocent blood in vain, is not his guilt even more unbearable if he came
from a distinguished family?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Concerning these questions, it appears to our master that explanation
lies in the law that one who has illicit relations with a Gentile woman
may be executed by a zealot, but which we do not teach publicly. Now one
must understand why, if this indeed is the law, the law does not uproot
the mountain and why do we not teach the law publicly. Our master
explained that only one whose jealousy for the Eternal burns like a
flame upon seeing holiness desecrated by another who has illicit
relations in broad daylight with a Gentile woman and whose soul, seeing
this outrage, can find no refuge except by executing the perpetrator
immediately. However, one who could control himself sufficiently to ask
the opinion of the sages who know law and judgment is not such a jealous
man and would not be fighting on behalf of the Almighty. This is why we
do not teach this law publicly.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This was also the complaint of the tribes who poured scorn and contempt
on him by saying: "Did you see this son of Puti who emerged naked from
the womb of an idolatrous Gentile woman? How could one such as he be so
jealous for the L-rd G-d of Israel that he could not control himself and
slew a prince of Israel? It was only because of the excessive
haughtiness within him that he did this deed." The Scripture therefore
connected his genealogy to Aharon, the holy one of the Eternal, which is
what inspired him to rise up, with a burning spirit of justice, to take
vengeance on behalf of the Eternal.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And in this light how well may we understand the words of the Midrash
which says about the verse (Numbers 25:12): "Wherefore, say, Behold I
give unto him my covenant of peace." 
(לָכֵן אֱמֹר  הִנְנִי נֹתֵן לוֹ אֶת-בְּרִיתִי שָׁלוֹם)
By right, may he take his reward (בדין הוא שיטול שכרו).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
According to what has been said, the words of the Midrash are like pure
silver, because the Sages say that there is no reward in this world for
the performance of commandments. For the Eternal does not reward those
who do good here below in order not to close the way before those who
would do evil. For if the actions of a person were recompensed in this
world, then the choice in the hands of every person to do as he wants
would be negated. Who then would not hurry to perform all the
commandments of the Eternal? Would one not be a hired laborer, coming
with his reward to do the work before him? However, the commandment that
a man should be jealous for his G-d cannot be done for recompense. For
then would he not be taking a man's life? And would this not be just
like a man rising against his neighbor and slaying him? Instead of a
reward, his violence would come down upon his own head, and the G-d of
vengeance would avenge his blood. Only the man who truly and
wholeheartedly is jealous on behalf of the Eternal and whose anger burns
for the desecration of His name of honor may take such an action. It is
therefore just that he would receive his reward here on earth, because
there is no reason to fear that everyone else would act similarly for
the sake of reward, because had he done so for the sake of a reward he
would have been considered a murderer

Rashi comments:
The law on this subject escaped him. Here he received punishment because
he had assumed "a crown" (he had set himself up as the supreme judge) by
saying, (Deuteronomy 1:17): "And the case that is too hard for you ye
shall bring to me, and I will hear it."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now one may wonder what "crown" the master takes if he tells his student
that if any matter is too difficult the student may consult with him? In
saying this he has not said that he will certainly respond to him and
resolve his doubt. A further question concerns precisely what Moshe said
"and the case that is too hard for you, ye shall bring to me," because
it was so obvious that it need not have been said. It is obvious that
what is too difficult for the students should be brought to their master.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
But our master explained in the name of his father (R. Avraham Glasner
1826-78) that the verse about which we are speaking was concerned with a
different issue, for there Moshe said: "You shall not be partial in
judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be
afraid of the face of any man." His meaning was: "If you ever feel
within yourselves that you are tending to one side because of respect or
fear, then you should withdraw from judgment. But bring the case before
me and I will hear it, because to me they are all equal. And neither
hatred, nor love, and neither the greatness nor the smallness of a
person will make any impression on my heart."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And this was why Moshe was punished here, for the daughters of
Tz'laphhad bribed him when they spoke to him (Numbers 27:3): "Our father
died in the wilderness; he was not in the company of those who gathered
themselves together against the L-rd in the company of Korah." This
comment is evidently irrelevant to their case. But they wished to inform
Moshe that their father was one of his friends at the time that Korah
and his company rose up against him. So when they said this to him,
Moshe felt a partiality in his heart to an extent that left him unable
to judge their case. And so he brought forward their case before the L-rd.

</span></p><p><span class="c1">

This is why the Sages said that here Moshe was punished for having taken
a "crown" by saying "and the case that is too hard for you, you shall
bring to me, and I will hear it."

      <p><span class="c1">      
See how Rashi explains the repetitive expressions, while the
Ibn Ezra wrote that "אֲשֶׁר יוֹצִיאֵם" (who may lead them out) is by means
of an agent.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And to our master it appears that a leader who walks at the head of the
people to show them the way on which they should travel and the deeds
that they should perform must be able to speak eloquently and to conduct
himself fittingly. Therefore, by saying "אֲשֶׁר יֵצֵא לִפְנֵיהֶם"
(who will go out before them), Moshe was referring to the deeds of a
leader and to the work of his hands. And when he said 
"וַאֲשֶׁר יוֹצִיאֵם וַאֲשֶׁר יְבִיאֵם" (who may lead them out and bring them in) with his
words (Ecclesiastes 12:11): "the words of the wise are goads" 
(דברי חכמים כדרבונות).
