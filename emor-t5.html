          In the Midrash (Leviticus Rabbah 26:1) it is written:
          R. Tanhum son of R. Hannilai opened his discourse with the
          text (Psalms
          12:7), "The words of the Lord are pure" (</span>אמרות ה' אמרות
        טהורות<span class="c1">).
          Does this mean that only "the words of the Lord are pure
          words" and the
          words of mortals are not pure words? It is the way of the
          world that if
          a mortal king enters a province and all the citizens of that
          province
          praise him, then if their praise is pleasant to him he tells
          them:
          "Tomorrow I shall build for you public baths and bathhouses,
          tomorrow I
          shall construct a canal for you." Then he falls asleep and
          does not
          rise. Where then is he and where are his words? The Holy One
          Blessed Be
          He, however, is not so, but The Lord G-d is the true G-d (</span>וה'
        אלהים אמת<span class="c1">) (Jeremiah 10:10). Why is He true?
          Because, said R. Abin, He
          is the living G-d, and the everlasting King (</span>שהוא אלהים
        חיים ומלך עולם<span class="c1">) (Id.)
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          R. Tanhum properly deduced that the promises of the Eternal
          are pure,
          i.e. promises that are true and may be depended upon. The
          promises are
          called pure, because they come from a pure place and a holy
          source that
          is immortal and thus can never become impure. The promises of
          flesh and
          blood, however, are not pure and may not be trusted, because
          their
          source is a decaying body that must eventually become a dead
          corpse. The
          promises of such a being are therefore impure.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          However, we must still try to understand why R. Tanhum
          expounded his
          words here in connection with this verse. And it appears to
          our master
          that R. Tanhum wished to explain why the words "and you shall
          say" were
          repeated twice (</span>אמור ואמרת<span class="c1">). The word
          "</span>בעמיו<span class="c1">" (among his people),
          which the Sages understand as a reference to an abandoned
          corpse (</span>מת מצוה<span class="c1">), is also redundant.
          Thus, R. Tanhum teaches us that since the
          promises made by human beings are impure, one who relies on
          human
          promises defiles his soul with an impurity more severe than
          that
          occasioned by entering into a tent in which there is a corpse.
          Now if a
          man actually sees his friend and colleague, with whom only
          yesterday he
          spoke face-to-face, today being laid to eternal rest, he will
          draw the
          appropriate lesson that he should not place his trust in
          princes whose
          breath will cease and who will return to dust. But if he does
          not see
          this happen with his own eyes, he may not draw that lesson.
          And this is
          why the wisest of men said (Eccleisastes 7:2): "It is better
          to go to
          the house of mourning than to the house of feasting, for this
          is the end
          of all men, and the living will lay it to heart."
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          Now the priests who have no share in the land and whose eyes
          are
          directed for their own support toward the holy offerings of
          the Children
          of Israel, their tithes, and their heave-offerings, must be
          especially
          careful not to place their trust in human beings and not to be
          overly
          regarding of the wealthy. So because the Eternal commanded the
          priests
          not to defile themselves by coming into contact with a corpse,
          they will
          have no occasion to see a dead person with their own eyes and
          therefore
          will be unable to draw from their own experience the lesson
          that they
          should not place their confidence in flesh and blood and not
          depend on a
          fragile reed. The priests, therefore, are susceptible to an
          even greater
          defilement than that of coming into contact with a corpse,
          which would
          be to rely on the promises of flesh and blood, thereby
          incurring a loss
          greater than their gain. The Scripture therefore repeats the
          command to
          speak to the priests (</span>אמור
        ואמרת<span class="c1">) "none of them shall defile himself
          for the dead" (</span>לנפש לא יטמא<span class="c1">). The
          priests may not permit
          themselves to be physically defiled through contact with any
          corpse. But
          beyond this, they must guard their souls from being defiled
          "among their
          people" (</span>בעמיו<span class="c1">),
          by placing their trust in any person still living
          among their people. And that is why the Midrash for this
          poroshah begins
          here with the holy verse "The words of the Lord are pure." </span></p>

          He shall not defile himself as a

      <p><span class="c1">
          The Sages deduced that this refers to the prohibited wife of a
          priest by
          whom he has been rendered unfit to perform any priestly
          service. But see
          the Ibn Ezra who wrote in his commentary that if it were not
          for the
          derivation of the Sages, he would have said simply that a
          priest is not
          allowed to defile himself even for a legal wife. And he would
          have
          explained the verse above (Leviticus 21:2): "except for his
          nearest of
          kin" (</span>כי אם לשארו הקרוב אליו<span class="c1">) to be a
          general description that
          does not include his wife.
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1">
          But it appears to our master that the derivation of the Sages
          holds of
          necessity, because if we were to interpret the verse simply to
          mean that
          a priest must not defile himself for his wife whether she be
          prohibited
          or permissible, what meaning would we attach to the words "to
          profane
          himself" (</span>להחלו<span class="c1">)? And even if we
          interpreted these words, as the
          Ramban does, to mean that a priest would demean himself in the
          eyes of
          the people by involving himself in the burial of his deceased
          wife, then
          why were these words not written above, i.e.: "none of them
          shall defile
          himself for the dead among his people and so profane himself"
          (</span>לנפש לא יטמא בעמיו להחלו<span class="c1">) instead of
          here: "he shall not defile
          himself as a husband and so profane himself" (</span>
          לא  יטמא בעל בעמיו להחלו<span
          class="c1">)? Moreover, writing "</span>לנפש לא יטמא בעמיו
        להחלו<span class="c1">"
          would have better indicated that a priest may defile himself
          for an
          unclaimed corpse (</span>מת מצוה<span class="c1">) than simply
          writing "</span>בעמיו<span class="c1">," inasmuch
          as it could not be supposed that a priest, by being occupied
          in the
          burial of a </span>מת מצוה<span class="c1">, would demean
          himself. We would therefore
          certainly have known that a priest is enjoined to defile
          himself for the
          sake of a </span>מת מצוה<span class="c1">. And even the one
          that holds that we do not
          deduce any halakhah from the reason for which a commandment
          was enjoined
          concedes that, when the Scripture explicitly states the reason
          for a
          commandment, we make an inference from an explicit reason. But
          it is
          clear that the word "</span>להחלו<span class="c1">" was not
          intended to explain why a priest
          may not defile himself through contact with a corpse, but
          rather serves
          as a reference to a prohibited wife by whom a priest has been
          profaned.
