See the Ramban who explains that this chapter was specifically
transmitted to the heads of the tribes to indicate, as the Sages derive
in the Talmud (Nedarim 78a-b), that they are authorized to nullify vows
and oaths. The concept of invalidating vows has no basis in the
Scripture (היתר נדרים פורחים באויר), and it hangs here only on a
slender thread, so that the people should not take vows and oaths
lightly. And he also wrote that perhaps it was necessary to keep the
concept of invalidating vows hidden from them.
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
To enlarge on the words of the Ramban, our master said that the Torah
did not suspect that the people would take lightly the vows that they
make to the Eternal. On the contrary, the Torah commanded us not to
desecrate our words to the Eternal to train us that all our words should
be treated as holy - that we should take care to fulfill whatever we
promise, even to a friend, that we not lie to another and that our "yes"
and our "no" should be just. "For this is the whole duty of man"
 (כִּי-זֶה כָּל-הָאָדָם) (Ecclesiastes 12:13).
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
The Scripture therefore writes "he shall not break his word" 
(שלא יחלל דבריו), referring to our word to the Eternal so that we will learn to
fulfill whatever we promise to our friend. The Sages relied on this
verse for the concept of invalidating vows, because it is apparent from
here that the reason that one may not violate his words to the Eternal
is so that we may learn to fulfill whatever we promise to a friend. The
Sages therefore inferred, "he may not break his word, but others may
allow him to do so," because if it should become necessary to come to a
sage to invalidate his vow, the sage will invalidate only the
prohibitions that he imposed upon himself, but will not invalidate any
promise made to another person.
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
However, since people might think that the sages are empowered to
invalidate vows that have been made to another person - as, indeed, our
enemies among the Gentiles say that we do to them and as Zedekiah, king
of Judea, did when he commanded the Sanhedrin to annul the vow that he
made to Nebuchadnezzar (see Nedarim 65a), the Scripture therefore hung
the invalidation of vows on a slender thread and, as the Ramban wrote,
explained it only through hints.

Rashi comments:
"This is the word" (זֶה הַדָּבָר). It is a restrictive phrase intimating
that the sage makes use of the expression "invalidating" (התרה), and
the husband (concerning his wife's vows), the expression "annulling"
(הפרה)
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
This is a forced deduction inasmuch as no "invalidation" of a vow is
based on any Scriptural text. And were it not for the words of the Sages
it would have appeared to our master to say that the verse: "This is the
word that the Lord has commanded a man when he makes a vow unto the
Lord" (זֶה הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה אִישׁ כִּי יִדֹּר נֶדֶר לַה')
shows what verbal formulation a person should use in making a vow. And
it appears to our master that our Sages relied on this to invent Aramaic
terminology for vows, a language not understood by the ministering
angels (מלאכי השרת), so that the Satan would not understand the
vow and then denounce the one making the vow, for anyone who makes a vow
is like one who builds a "high place" 
(כל הנודר כאילו בונה במה).
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
One can explain the relation between vowing and building a high place
based on the saying of the Sages that one who is commanded and fulfills
is greater than one who is not commanded but fulfills nevertheless
(גדול המצווה ועושה ממי שאינו מצווה ועושה). To explain this
saying, the Tosafot wrote that one who is commanded has a greater desire
to transgress the commandment incumbent upon him than one who is not
commanded, and his evil inclination is therefore more powerful, because
(Proverbs 9:17): "stolen waters are sweet" (מַיִם-גְּנוּבִים יִמְתָּקוּ), and
were it not for the assistance of the Holy One Blessed Be He, one could
not withstand his evil inclination.
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
If so, by making himself one who is commanded, one who makes a vow
incites the evil inclination within his soul. Why then should the
Eternal help one such as this to conquer his evil inclination? For did
he not bring everything upon himself? The Sages therefore properly
compared one who makes a vow to one who builds a high place, as our
master has explained at length elsewhere, and they adopted Aramaic terms
for vows, so that the evil inclination would not understand and then
seek to entice the one making a vow into breaking his word.
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
This is what is hinted at by the verse 
"אִישׁ כִּי יִדֹּר נֶדֶר לה'". It
means "if one does make a vow, one should do so in a way that the vow
will be known only to the Eternal." And the Scripture introduces the
topic by explaining how this should be done by saying: "this is the
word" as if to say that one should make a vow only with words such as
these that are open only to the Eternal, which means that one should use
the Aramaic terms that none but the Eternal - not even the angels -
understands.

Rashi comments:
They paid more regard to their property than to their sons and
daughters, because they mentioned their cattle before their children.
Moses said to them: "Not so! Make the chief thing the chief thing and
what is subordinate. First build cities for your little ones and
afterwards folds for your flocks."
                  </span></p><p><span class="c1">      
Our master interprets this verse in praise of the tribes and says that
they did not pay more regard to their cattle than to their children, for
did they not have dwelling places already built for them in the
conquered land of Sihon and Og where their children and wives could be
settled? However, these dwelling places were not fortified and not
surrounded by walls. And if they would take up arms to go before the
army, how could they leave their wives and children behind in open
cities at the mercy of the surrounding inhabitants. They therefore
suggested building sheepfolds for their cattle, which did not yet exist,
and they would make the cities that were already there habitable by
fortifying them with walls and latches. However, Moses, our teacher,
reversed their proposal for a different reason, for perhaps they would
suddenly be called upon to go before their brothers into battle before
finishing building the walls around their cities. How could they then
leave their children in such a vulnerable condition? He therefore
commanded them to build the walls for the cities first, so that they
would be ready to go out into battle with their brothers. That is why
Moses said: "Do what you have promised. That is why I command you to
build the cities first so that you will be ready at any moment to
fulfill your promise."
