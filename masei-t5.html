In the Midrash (Numbers Rabbah 23:9) it is written:
This refers to what Scripture says (Job 35:11) "Who teaches us more than
the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of the air?"
(מַלְּפֵנוּ מִבַּהֲמוֹת אָרֶץ   וּמֵעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם יְחַכְּמֵנוּ)
</span></p><p><span class="c1">      
This Midrash begs for interpretation. And it appears to our master that
it can be explained according to what the gaon the Hatan Sofer wrote
about the verse in which Jacob says to Esau (Genesis 33:10): "for truly
seeing your face is like seeing the face of G-d, with such favor have
you received me" (כִּרְאֹת פְּנֵי אֱלֹהִים וַתִּרְצֵנִי), asking how the
chosen of the fathers could have spoken so insincerely? But he answered
that there are two ways in which a person may be aroused to love and
reverence the Eternal. First (Proverbs 13:20): "He who walks with wise
men shall become wise" (הוֹלֵךְ אֶת חֲכָמִים יֶחְכָּם). Second, when he
sees the wickedness of the wicked, he will despise them and their dirty
deeds to the utmost degree and, for as long as he lives, will avoid any
action that resembles their actions. As King David said (Psalms 119:98):
"Thy commandment makes me wiser than my enemies" (מֵאֹיְבַי, תְּחַכְּמֵנִי). 
And this, according to our master, is the meaning of the
mishnah in Avot (4:1): "Who is a wise man (who can stand forever with
the strength of his wholeheartedness)? One who learns (to do good) from
every man (even from the deeds of the wicked and foolish).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
But the capacity to learn from everyone is possessed only by those who
are exalted, whose only longings are for the Eternal. Whatever they see
arouses them only to do good. However, those who are average or below
average may well be seduced and fall into the trap set by their evil
inclination, so that when they see the misdeeds of others they will say
"Let me also act in this way." That is why it is necessary to completely
destroy evil from the land, or at least to chase the wicked so far away
that their evil deeds cannot be seen, for a man cannot live in the
company of a serpent. The benefit of keeping the wicked nearby in order
to see their abominations and to despise them would not be worth the
damage that could result from their bad example. For can we not see in
the lower creatures strange things and indecent traits that are
revolting to the soul of a person? Nor, since these creatures are
incapable of speech, would we entertain any thought of turning after them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is the meaning of the verse (Numbers 33:52-55) "Then you shall
drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all
their figured stones . . . But if you do not drive out the inhabitants
of the land from before you, then those of them whom you let remain
shall be as pricks in your eyes." The intent of the verse is that should
you say "those that I will let remain in the land will be for me, on
account of their abominations, as pricks in my eyes from which I will
learn to do what is good," the Scripture replies that not only will you
not learn to what is good from them, but on the contrary, "they will
harass you" (וְצָרְרוּ אֶתְכֶם). Instead of teaching you, they will draw
you away from the path of goodness. And should you ask, "from where will
I learn to abominate and despise what is evil?" Concerning this
question, the Midrash quotes the verse: "Who teaches us more than the
beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?" It is
from them that you should learn to despise what is evil and to choose
what is good."

In Tosafot (Berakhot 20b, s.v. nashim) it is written that the Levites
and the priests did not take any portion of the land. A sage once asked
our master: "Does the Scripture not explicitly say here that the Levites
did take cities and two thousand cubits of open land around the cities?"
And our master replied that here the Scripture is commanding Israel to
give the Levites cities from their inheritance. But although the
children of Israel inherited all the land, they were commanded to give
the Levites land from their own holdings. And that is why the Levites,
unlike the other tribes, had no prince to distribute their cities to
them. And this is clear.

Rashi comments:
Another explanation for his staying in the city of refuge until the high
priest's death: Because the high priest should have prayed that this
misfortune might never happen in Israel in his days.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And if this is so, then the high priest is also being punished with the
murderer in that the murderer is praying for the death of the high
priest so that he can return home. We find in this a correct reason for
why the mishnah (Makot 1:1) teaches that conspiring witnesses who
falsely testified that someone murdered unintentionally receive lashes
instead of being exiled to a city of refuge as they conspired to do to
their brother. That they receive lashes rather than exile is derived in
the Gemara either from a Scriptural text or from a fortiori reasoning
(קל וחומר). But according to what has been said, we could not punish
the witnesses by exile to a city of refuge until the death of the high
priest, for if they sinned and gave false testimony, how was the high
priest at fault? No misfortune occurred and no man was killed, so why
should these two pray for his death? Nor could we condemn them to an
indeterminate exile independent of the life of the high priest, because
then the exile imposed on the witnesses would not be like the exile that
they had sought to impose on the defendant.
