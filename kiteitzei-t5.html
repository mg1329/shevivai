If a man has two wives, one beloved, and another hated . . . that he may
not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated,

It is puzzling that the Torah felt it necessary to inform us of this
law. For on what ground would we have supposed that a father, out of his
love for the mother of the second son, could treat the second son as if
he were the first-born son?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It appears to our master that the Scripture is here warning us not to
use the underlying rationale for a law as the basis for a halakhic
inference (שלא נדרוש טעמא דקרא). Thus, one might have said that
the reason why the Torah gave the first-born son the right to take a
double portion of his father's inheritance is that the first son issues
from the union between a husband and the wife of his youth, motivated by
a surpassing love and an absolute unity. As the product of such a loving
union and the first fruit of his father's strength, a first-born son is
thus endowed with noble and honorable qualities, as is apparent from the
opposite situation: the children of enmity and of conflict become
rebellious and sinful, "offspring of evil-doers, sons who deal
corruptly" (זֶרַע מְרֵעִים, בָּנִים מַשְׁחִיתִים) (Isaiah 1:4), as the Sages
deduce (Nedarim 20b)
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
"And I will purge out the rebels from among you and those who transgress
against Me" (וּבָרוֹתִי מִכֶּם הַמֹּרְדִים וְהַפּוֹשְׁעִים בִּי)
(Ezekiel 20:38). R. Levi said: This refers to children
belonging to one of the nine categories of enmity between a husband and
wife.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It might therefore be supposed that if a man has two wives, one beloved
and one hated, and his first-born son is the child of the hated wife,
the above reason for bestowing a double portion on the first-born son is
invalid, so that the son of the beloved wife is the more deserving of
the double portion. To counter such reasoning, the Scripture is teaching
us here not to use the underlying rationale for the law as the ground
for inferring any qualification in its application, and, thus, to allow
the father to treat the son of the beloved wife as if he were the
first-born son. The Torah emphasizes that it is the first-born son who
is the first fruit of his father's strength and therefore retains the
right to be treated as the first-born son under all circumstances.

If a man has a stubborn
and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the
voice of his mother, and who, when they have chastened him, will not
listen to them
</span> (Deuteronomy 21:18)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
In the Sifri, R. Yehudah says that if the boy's mother was unworthy of
his father, he cannot be judged a rebellious son. The Sages say in the
Talmud that by this he meant that the mother must be similar to the
father in voice, appearance, and height. What does this mean?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It appeared to our master to explain the matter in an aggadic fashion.
In the natural course of events a child will always listen intently to
the words of his father and mother and will be very careful to obey and
follow whatever they say. However, if the father and the mother are not
in accord but in conflict with each other, so that his father guides him
in one direction and his mother guides him in another, then their honor
will be diminished in his eyes. He will then not pay heed to either of
them any longer even in a matter about which they both agree. He will
stop caring about what they say and will not be interested in following
their advice. And this we also know from experience.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is what is meant by the verse "if a man has a stubborn and
rebellious son" (כִּי יִהְיֶה לְאִישׁ בֵּן סוֹרֵר וּמוֹרֶה). The reason that
the son is rebellious is that he "will not obey" (אֵינֶנּוּ שֹׁמֵעַ). But
understand that the son does not give heed, because he cannot give heed
and obey "to the voice of his father and the voice of his mother" (
 בְּקוֹל אָבִיו וּבְקוֹל אִמּוֹ). The word "voice" (קוֹל) is repeated to signify that
the parents' opinions are in conflict, so that the son cannot fulfill
the will of both. Therefore, even if "they both chastise him"
(וְיִסְּרוּ אֹתוֹ) about a matter that they both agree upon, 
"he will not give heed to
them" (וְלֹא יִשְׁמַע אֲלֵיהֶם), but instead tosses their words aside. It is
about this that R. Yehudah said, if his mother was unworthy of his
father, he cannot be judged a rebellious son, because such a verdict can
be rendered only if the father and the mother are in accord in all their
opinions and guide him along a single path. Only on this condition, if
he does not listen to them, may the verdict appropriate to a rebellious
son be rendered upon him.

If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or
on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the
young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young;
thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou mayest
take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
prolong thy days.

</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
In the Midrash Rabbah it is written:
This bears on the verse (Proverbs 4:23): Keep your heart with all
vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life" 
(מִכָּל מִשְׁמָר, נְצֹר לִבֶּךָ: כִּימִמֶּנּוּ תּוֹצְאוֹת חַיִּים).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
What is the connection between this verse and the commandment of sending
away the mother before taking the nestlings? It appears to our master to
explain that the Torah promises the same reward for fulfilling this
commandment as for honoring one's father and mother. Concerning both it
says (Deuteronomy 22:7), "that it may go well with you, and that you may
live long." (See also Deuteronomy 5:16)
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
But the Midrash (Deuteronomy Rabbah 6) finds it problematic that the
reward for the two commandments is the same,
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
"She does not take heed to the path of life" (Proverbs 5:6). The
honoring of parents is the weightiest commandment and its reward is long
life . . . and the sending away of the mother bird is the least
weighty,1 and what is its reward? Length of days.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
So it is astonishing that both commandments should carry the same
reward. But the matter may be explained as follows. If we should serve
the Eternal for the purpose of receiving a reward, just as a slave
serves his master, then we shall each receive a reward commensurate with
our service. The greater the service the greater the reward. But we may
also serve the Eternal in the manner of a son who serves his father, a
son whose every longing is to give honor to his father and to carry out
his wishes. If we serve the Eternal in this way, and all our desires and
longings are to serve Him in joy and gladness without regard for any
reward, then we shall all receive the same reward whether our service is
great or small. For then the Eternal will treat us just as a father who,
in dividing up his estate, does not distinguish among his children
according to how much service they provided him, and does not give a
larger portion to the son who was able to do more in his behalf and a
smaller one to the son who could provide only a trifling service.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is the meaning of the Midrash. The verse: "Keep your heart with all
vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life" teaches us that from
the equality between the reward for honoring one's parents with that for
sending away the mother before taking the nestlings, it is clear that it
is the intent of our heart which is of greatest importance. What is
essential is to direct our heart toward heaven, for it is from heaven
that the longevity mentioned here is bestowed.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And in this way one can explain what the Talmud says at the end of Hulin
(142a). A man once told his son to bring him nestlings and the son went
to the roof and brought the young birds from their nest and on his way
down the son fell to his death. What happened, the Talmud asks, to the
longevity that this one was promised for obeying his father and for
sending away the mother before taking the nestlings? And the Talmud
replies that perhaps he had been harboring idolatrous thoughts, by which
the Talmud must have meant that the son did not perform the commandments
with the proper intent, for the sake of the Eternal to give Him
satisfaction, but instead performed them only for the sake of reward.
And this improper intention was referred to metaphorically as
"idolatrous." For his intention was not to serve the Eternal, but to
serve himself. And although the Eternal does provide a reward even to
those who serve Him for the sake of a reward, the longevity promised in
this verse relates only to those who serve Him out of love.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Another answer that one might offer is that our Sages say that one who
says that the commandment of sending away the mother before taking the
nestlings is instructed to keep silent. And this presumably applies to
anyone who provides a reason for any of the commandments dictated by
reason such as honoring one's parents. The Talmud thus may have meant to
say that perhaps the son fell to his death because he had been thinking
that he was performing these commandments out of mercy, and because he
performed the commandments with that intention, his performance of them
did not safeguard him against a fatal mishap. Perhaps this was also the
meaning of the Midrash: "Keep your heart with all vigilance." Do not
think that we perform the commandments of the Eternal out of mercy.
