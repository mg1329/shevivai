In the Midrash (Numbers Rabbah 2:2): Thus it says (Psalms 20:6), "We will shout for joy in Thy salvation, and
in the name of our G-d we will set our standards" 
(נרננה בישועתך ובשם אלהינו נדגול)
      </p><p><span class="c1">
Our master says that the Midrash wanted to show us the difference
between the flags that the children of Israel followed on their journeys
and the flags that all the other nations raise on the day of battle. To
them a flag is merely a sign by which all the warriors can orient
themselves and find their place in battle. When the divisions of their
armies are organized, individual soldiers are not arranged by family
origins, but are distributed randomly into divisions and battalions. Not
so the children of Israel and their flags, for each man travels
alongside his own family. The Israelites dwell among their own tribes,
and then the Eternal dwells in honor among them. The sages of the Talmud
deduce (Yevamot 42a) from the verse (Genesis 17:7) "to be G-d to you and
your descendants after you" (להיות לך לאלהים ולזרעך אחריך) 
that a woman may not remarry until it can be determined
whether, if a child were born, it would be the child of her first
husband born after nine months, or the child or her second husband born
after seven months. And Rashi comments that the Shehinah dwells only
among those whose legitimacy can be confirmed, those whose future
offspring will have an unquestionable lineage.

The Scripture therefore writes "each with the ensign of his father's
house" (איש על דגלו באותות לבית אבותם), because it is not enough that
there just be ensigns. The ensigns must be "of his father's house,"
representing the source of his existence. This is not the practice of
those schooled in battle and of those who draw the bow of heroes. That
is why the Midrash identifies this verse with the verse "We shall shout
for joy in Thy victory, And in the name of our G-d we will set up our
standards," because (Psalms 20:8) "some boast of chariots and some boast
of horses, but we boast of the name of the Lord our G-d" 
(אלה ברכב ואלה בסוסים יערכו מלחמה, אבל אנחנו בשם אלהינו נזכיר),
Who has put His sanctuary in our midst. That is why the Children of
Israel carry the ensigns of their fathers' houses and go forward while
surrounding the Tabernacle where the glory of the Eternal is seen, for
that is where He has selected His dwelling place .

Rashi comments:
The Scripture mentions only the sons of Aaron who were called the
generations of Moses because he taught them Torah
	  </span></p>      <p><span class="c1">   
One may ask: did Moses not teach Torah to all the people of Israel, so
that they may all be considered his children? Why then were only the
sons of Aaron referred to as the sons of Moses?
	  </span></p>      <p><span class="c1">   
And concerning the passage "in the day that the Lord spoke with Moses in
Mount Sinai" (ביום דבר ה' את משה בהר סני), Rashi comments:
These (the sons of Aaron) became his children, because he taught them
what he heard from the Almighty
	  </span></p>      <p><span class="c1">   
This is also difficult, because, according to Rashi's explanation, the
Scripture should have written "in the day that Moses spoke to the sons
of Aaron." But if it were not for the words of Rashi, it would have
appeared to our master to say that the reason that the sons of Aaron
were also considered to be the sons of Moses is that the sons of Aaron
died instead of Moses and Aaron on the day on which Moses finished the
construction of the Tabernacle. The sons of Aaron venerated the Holy One
of Israel, as Moses then said to Aaron (Leviticus 10:3): "This is what
the Lord spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near to
me." Moses continued: "I knew that the Sanctuary would be sanctified by
one of those who was acquainted with Him, and I thought that it would be
either I or you." For did not the Eternal say to Moses on the day on
which He commanded him to build a Sanctuary (Exodus 29:43): "And there I
will meet with the children of Israel; and [the Sanctuary] will be
sanctified by My glory (ונועדתי לך שמה ונקדש בכבודי)"? 
Thus, Nadab and Abihu died in place of Moses and Aaron when
they brought up the strange fire. A son is considered as the knee of his
father because the father is built up from the son even after the
father's death so that the father's flame is not extinguished. Thus,
anyone who dies in place of another may be considered as a son to him,
because he added to his life. The Scripture says "these are the
generations of Aaron and Moses," because they are also the generations
of Moses. And when the Scripture refers to "the day that the Lord spoke
with Moses in Mount Sinai," it is referring to the moment when G-d said
to Moses "and there I will meet with the children of Israel; and [the
Sanctuary] will be sanctified by My glory." The sons of Aaron died
instead of Moses and thus became sons to Moses, because, as a result of
them, Moses was able to remain alive.
