The Lord came from Sinai, and
rose up from Seir to them; he shone forth from Mount Paran, and he came
with holy tens of thousands; from his right hand went a fiery law for
them.

The Sifri comments on this verse that before the Omnipresent One
revealed Himself to give the Torah to Israel, He first revealed Himself
to all the nations.
The descendants of Esau asked G-d, "What is written in it?"
G-d answered, "Thou shalt not kill."
They responded, "Our ancestor was a killer to the core of his being."
G-d then went to the descendants of Amon and Moab. They asked Him, "What
is written in it?"
G-d answered, "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
They responded, "Our ancestor was an adulterer to his core."
G-d then went to the descendants of Ishmael to offer them the Torah.
They asked Him, "What is written in it?"
G-d answered, "Thou shalt not steal."
They responded, "Our ancestor was a thief to the core of his being."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Sifri is amazing because these three prohibitions were among the
Seven Noahide Laws, which all the nations had long since been commanded
to observe. How is it that G-d would have mentioned these commandments
to them? And what did they accomplish by refusing to accept the Torah,
which they had been obligated to observe since Creation?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And it appears to our master to say that the Torah that G-d gave us was
permeated with kindness and truth, her laws are righteous altogether,
and her ways are the ways of pleasantness and peace, so that the Torah
does not impose a harsh law on these three destructive crimes: stealing,
adultery, and murder that annihilate peace and destroy the land.
Instead, the Torah treats them with mercy and great compassion, because
one who steals from his neighbor and is found with the stolen object
obtains forgiveness for his sin by making a two-fold restitution to his
neighbor. And although the murderer and the adulterer are liable to the
death penalty, they can only be executed on the testimony of at least
two witnesses who must be subjected to searching examination by the
court. Nor can capital punishment be administered unless the offenders
were properly warned before they perpetrated the offense. And their case
must be judged in a court of twenty-three judges. So difficult was it to
impose capital punishment that R. Akiva and R. Tarfon said that if they
had been judges when courts were imposing capital punishment, no one
would ever have been executed.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now righteous and enlightened laws such as these are appropriate only
for a wise and understanding people whose wisdom shines forth from them
who are abundantly endowed with wisdom, talent and lofty
characteristics. However, a contemptible and degenerate people, like the
nations of ancient times, who were all murderers and adulterers, robbers
and plunderers, would have, under such liberal laws, lived in chaos not
order, because they would not have feared the sword of the law. And so
the land would have been filled with violence, theft, and adultery. In
truth, under the Noahide Laws, the death penalty could be imposed by one
judge on the testimony of one witness and without warning, and violation
of any commandment was a capital offense, because only by prosecuting
the people ferociously could they be restrained.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The leaders and ministers of all the nations through whom G-d wanted to
give His Torah, therefore, would not accept it, because, even though the
Torah encompassed the Seven Noahide Laws that they had already received,
under the rules of justice of the Torah, anyone violating those laws
would not be swiftly punished. How then could they continue to lead
their peoples whose offenses weighed so heavily upon them? And this is
what the leaders of each nation answered: "their ancestor was a murder
to the core of his being," or "they are thoroughly immoral," or "they
are thieves." For the people are very wild; they are violent and
deceitful, and how could we lead them with laws as upright and
enlightened as these?

Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents. They
shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices
of righteousness; for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and
of treasures hidden in the sand.
</span> (Deuteronomy 33: 18 - 19)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Our master explained that Zebulun and Issachar entered into a covenant
under which Zebulun would dwell on the sea-coast to conduct
international trade and commerce while Issachar, supported by Zebulun,
would dwell in his tents and would study Torah day and night. And
although all the tribes of the Almighty would indeed draw out their
souls to the hungry and would perform charity and kindness when they
would go up to appear before the Eternal where they would bring
sacrifices, tithes, and heave-offerings with which to nourish the souls
of the priests and the poor and to provide for them from their own
bounty, the nation did so only when all of Israel gathered together in
the sight of all. It was not such public gifts that the tribe of Zebulun
gave, for they gave from their own food to the poor and supported the
poor from their own table even when they were at home and their
generosity could not be publicly noted. The Eternal, therefore, did not
withhold that which is good from its rightful owners and gave Zebulun a
reward commensurate with their generosity. So if they lent a hand to the
needy in secret and did not withhold a covert gift from the
impoverished, then the Eternal also rewarded them from secret
storehouses - the abundance of the seas (shepha yamim) - which were
overlooked in his rich territory and were hidden from view and could not
be taken without Zebulun's permission. As the Sages said in the Talmud
(Megilah 6a):
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Zevulun said before the Holy One Blessed Be He: "Who will inform me
about and pay compensation for the hilazon and the hidden treasures of
the sand in my territory?"
He replied: "Whoever takes from you without payment will not prosper in
his business."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
That is why Zebulun did not have to stand guard over his property. And
this is the meaning of the verse: "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out."
Zebulun was able to travel far away in his trading ships, in happiness
and good cheer, without fearing that strangers would seize what belonged
to him. And if so, it was as if all his property were hidden, because he
held the hand and provided for the welfare of Issachar in the privacy of
his tents, which is the meaning of "Issachar in your tents" (וְיִשָּׂשכָר
בְּאֹהָלֶיךָ). The subsequent verse "They shall call peoples unto the
mountain" (עַמִּים הַר יִקְרָאוּ) refers, as Rashi explains, to the tribes of
Israel who will go up to the holy mountain in Jerusalem where they will
offer "sacrifices of righteousness" (זִבְחֵי צֶדֶק) and will give gifts
to the poor. However, the passage "for they shall suck the abundance of
the seas" refers, as Rashi explains, to Zebulun and Issachar, for these
two came under the moral obligation of a covenant whereby Zebulun
provided for the needs of Issachar and Issachar taught Zebulun Torah and
skills. Therefore, both these two "suck from the abundance of the seas
and the hidden treasures of the sand."

      <p><span class="c2"> 
Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents. 
</span> (Deuteronomy 33: 18)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Our master explained this verse according to the words of Qohelet
(Ecclesiastes 11:9): "Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your
heart cheer you in the days of your youth; walk in the ways of your
heart, and in the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things
G-d will bring you into judgment." For in a time of joy and happiness,
one should always keep in mind that the time will surely come when G-d
will bring him to judgment for what he has done. And in this way, one
will withhold himself from transgressing even at a time of celebration
and revelry. This is similar to what the Sages say in the Talmud: "One
should always incite his good inclination against his evil inclination.
But if he does not overcome his evil inclination, let him remind himself
of the day of his death and thereby be delivered from trouble without
transgressing."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, the sages who study the Torah do not do battle against the evil
inclination in this way, but rather, by increasing their dedication to
the study of the Torah of the Eternal. This is how they smite the evil
inclination down to the earth. As the Sages say, if the disgusting one
meets you, lead him to the house of study. Thus, the Torah protects
scholars and saves them from transgression even if they do not recall
the day of death.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Our master explained in this way the Scripture (Ecclesiastes 7:12): "For
the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money; and the
advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has
it." This means that with money a man can perfect his soul for the sake
of the Eternal by doing kindness and charity. But the advantage of
knowledge is that at the time when his mortal enemy, the evil
inclination, threatens to overwhelm him, he will be able to defeat the
evil inclination by studying the Torah. The evil inclination will then
melt as does wax before a fire, without any recollection of the bitter
day of death. Thus the meaning of the verse "rejoice, Zebulun, in your
going out" is that in a time of happiness and rejoicing he must recall
the day of his departure from the world in order to avoid transgression.
But Issachar, the model of a Torah scholar, will subdue his evil
inclination in his tent, the tent of study, without having to recall the
bitter day.

וְלֹא קָם נָבִיא עוֹד בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל כְּמֹשֶׁה אֲשֶׁר יְדָעוֹ יְהוָה פָּנִים אֶל פָּנִים

And there has not arisen since in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the Lord
knew face to face.      
</span> (Deuteronomy 34:10)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Rashi comments:
This means that he was familiar with Him and used to speak with Him at
any time he desired.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
See the Ramban who asks that if this is so, the Scripture should have
said, "who knew (יָדַע) the Lord face to face" instead of "whom the Lord
knew (יְדָעוֹ) face to face." He therefore interpreted the verse to mean
that Moses knew the Eternal by name.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
But to our master the words of Rashi seem correct according to the
opinion of the Ran who stated that the greatness of the Moses and his
exalted prophecy was not the achievement of his own efforts, for it is
not within the capacity of a human being fashioned from physical
material to elevate his own soul so high and to raise himself to such a
level to see the shining vision. Rather it was the Eternal from on high
who shed upon him a great spirit of prophecy and shined upon him a
light, because it was necessary for the prophet through whom the Torah
would be given to the people of Israel to be very great, only just short
of an angel. That is why the Scripture says "And there has not arisen a
prophet since in Israel like Moses," for as long as the world exists no
other person will ever reach so high a level.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
According to this, the Scripture properly says "whom the Lord knew face
to face," because Moses's knowledge of the Eternal was not the result of
his own effort and preparation, but was entirely the gift of the
Eternal. It was the Eternal who enabled Moses to know Him, which is the
meaning of "יְדָעוֹ". This is why there has not arisen since a prophet
like Moses.
