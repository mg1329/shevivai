Our
master explained this verse in accord with the commentators on the פיוט
of the ימים נוראים "A man may prepare the thoughts in his mind, but
the power of speech comes from the L-rd" (לְאָדָם מַעַרְכֵי לֵב וּמֵה' מַעֲנֵה
לָשׁוֹן) who say that if listeners, wishing to
learn how to do what is good, focus their minds and hearts on the
Eternal to hear instruction and wisdom from the one who reproves them,
then the Eternal will enhance the eloquence of the speaker who will
deliver an upright discourse sweeter than honey and the honeycomb that
will draw the hearts of those listening toward him. However, if they
come hear his discourse, only for enjoyment and to take pleasure in the
speaker's eloquence and intelligence, but they are not sincere and they
do not want to hear reproof and instruction to improve their conduct,
then the Eternal will not give the speaker (Isaiah 50:4) "the tongue of
those who are taught" (לשון לימודים), so that the listeners will not
gain their desire to enjoy his pleasant discourse and so that their
guilt for rejecting moral instruction should be mitigated. So did
Yishayahu the prophet say (Isaiah 29:13-14): "Because this people draw
near with their mouth and honor me with their lips," for they came close
to hear his beautiful oratory and his lofty visions. But "their hearts
are far from me" and they did not turn to hearken to him. That is why
"the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the discernment of their
discerning men shall be hid." so that they will not be able to
accomplish their goal.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now the letter "ה" in the word "וַאֲדַבֵּרָה" is added, as the
grammarians know, to adorn the language. And Moshe was, from his youth,
slow of speech and of a slow tongue; his speech was like that of
stammerers and was unpleasant to hear. But if the Eternal placed words
in his mouth and the Divine Presence was speaking from his throat, he
then spoke words of beauty and his tongue was that "of those who are
taught." As the Midrash in פרשת דברים says about him "The tree of
life heals speech." This then is the meaning of the verse: "Give ear, O
heavens" (הַאֲזִינוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם). If those who approach the one who gives
reproof are dedicated toward heaven, because they wish to turn away from
evil and to improve their conduct, and it is called "giving ear"
(הַאֲזִינוּ) when one listens to the words of the reprover with the
intention of acting accordingly, then "I will speak" (וַאֲדַבֵּרָה) with
a pure speech, with the perfection of beauty," which is represented by
the extra "ה" Alternatively, the "ה" may symbolize the Divine
Presence that speaks from his throat. But if "the earth will hear"
(וְתִשְׁמַע הָאָרֶץ), that is if they come to satisfy the desire of their
heart to hear the smooth words of eloquent speakers, which is referred
to as "hearing" (שמיעה) and not "giving ear" (האזנה), then what
they will hear will be the "words of my mouth" (אִמְרֵי פִי), because I am
slow of speech and of uncircumcised lips.

My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the
dew; as the small rain upon the tender grass, and as the showers upon
the herb.

</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
See what we wrote in the name of our master
in פרשת דברים that if one offers reproof to the people by relying
on what is written in the Torah and does not simply offer reproof based
on his own opinions, he will be well received by his audience even if he
speaks sternly. But it will not be so if he will speak what he has made
up from his own heart. When he offers reproof from his own heart, he
should be careful to speak gently, words of pleasantness, to draw the
hearts of his audience toward him. And this is what is meant by "may my
teaching drop as rain" (יַעֲרֹף כַּמָּטָר לִקְחִי). Moshe will be able to
speak sternly to them like a strong rain that buffets the ground if he
speaks words of reproof that are taken ("לִקְחִי") from a holy place, the
wellspring of the Torah. However, when Moshe speaks his own words
("אִמְרָתִי"), they should be spoken gently and slowly ("תִּזַּל כַּטַּל")
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
A second rule for one who offers reproof is that it is appropriate to
speak sternly only to a large gathering. But if one is speaking directly
to an individual he should speak elliptically and gently in order not to
humiliate the individual to whom one is offering reproof. And see Rashi
who explains "שְׂעִירִם" as a stormy wind and "רְבִיבִים" as rain drops;
"deshe" is a general term encompassing all the folliage that covers the
land, and "עֵשֶׂב" is a term for each individual type of vegetation. That
is why the noun "שְׂעִירִם," representing a harsher form of reproof is
coupled with "עֲלֵי עֵשֶׂב" corresponding to a harsh reproof to all the
people as a group, while "רְבִיבִים", representing a gentle reproof, is
coupled with "עֲלֵי עֵשֶׂב," indicating that it is directed toward a
single individual.

Is corruption His? No; His children's is the blemish; a generation
crooked and perverse.
</span> (Deuteronomy 32:5)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Our master said that
if a father has been brought up according to the precepts of the Torah,
but then becomes corrupt in his conduct, he is nevertheless disposed to
return to the Eternal in the moment of his distress or in the days of
repentance, because he knows that he has sinned against the Eternal. He
will therefore quickly resolve to repent and repair his wrongful
conduct. This is the meaning of the words: "Is corruption his?" (שִׁחֵת
לוֹ). The Scripture responds: "No" (לֹא); his guilt is not considered to
be very great, because he will undoubtedly repent. But "his children's
is the blemish" (בָּנָיו מוּמָם). If his children have grown up being
accustomed to transgress, their sins are considered as a hereditary
blemish that cannot be removed until they perish, because they are "a
generation crooked and perverse" (דּוֹר עִקֵּשׁ וּפְתַלְתֹּל) and they will
never repent.
