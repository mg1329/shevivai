      <p><span class="c2"> And G-d spoke to Moses (Exodus 6:2) </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The Midrash Yalqut Shimoni writes concerning
          this verse:<br>
          This refers to the verse (Psalms 50:7): "Hear, O, My people,
          and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against you:
          G-d, I am your G-d" (</span>שמעה עמי ואדברה ישראל ואעידה בך
        אלהים אלהיך אנכי<span class="c1">). [Note: The Midrash
          understands the verse to read "I will testify that you are
          G-d, I am your G-d] The Holy One Blessed Be He said to Moses,
          because I have called you "G-d" - as it is written (Exodus
          7:1): "See I make you as G-d to Pharaoh" (</span>ראה נתתיך
        אלהים לפרעה<span class="c1">) - "I am your G-d" (</span>אלהיך
        אנכי<span class="c1">). That is why it is written, "And G-d
          spoke to Moses" </span><span class="c1">(</span>וידבר אלהים
        אל משה<span class="c1"></span><span class="c1"></span><span
          class="c1">). And this Midrash seems beyond comprehension. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> It appears to our master to explain that one
          could well ask why the mission of Moses did not, at first,
          achieve its objective, and, on the contrary, provoked Pharaoh
          to intensify the enslavement of the people, just as Moses
          cried out (Exodus 5:23), "For since I came to Pharaoh to speak
          in Thy name, he has done evil with this people" (</span>מאז
        באתי אל פרעה לדבר בשמך הרע לעם הזה<span class="c1">). How could
          the trustworthy G-d not respond at all to this complaint? </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> However, we may explain this turn of events,
          relying on the Yalqut Shimoni to the verse (Hosea 2:1) "and it
          shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said unto
          them: You are not My people, it shall be said of them: You are
          the children of the living G-d" (</span>והיה במקום אשר יאמר
        להם לא עמי אתם יאמר להם בני אל חי<span class="c1">). The Yalqut
          on that verse offers a parable of a king who became angry at
          his wife and sent for a scribe to write a bill of divorce.
          Before the scribe arrived, the king became reconciled with his
          wife, so, when the scribe arrived, the king said: "Shall I
          just let this scribe leave empty-handed? Since he has come,
          let me double the value of her marriage contract." Similarly
          the messengers of the Deity are not sent out in vain. Thus, if
          messengers of rage are sent out to cause destruction, and
          those who were to be destroyed repent from their evil ways,
          the messengers of evil are transformed into angels of mercy to
          bestow blessings beyond measure. Thus, the Sages say about the
          waters of Noah, which are described as both "rain" (</span>ויהי
        הגשם<span class="c1">) and "flood" (</span>מבול הארץ<span
          class="c1">), that G-d at first caused rain to fall with the
          intention that, if the people would only repent, the rain
          would be a blessing and not a curse. However, when they
          persisted in their rebellious spirit, the rain became a flood
          to destroy all flesh. So it is with the good. If G-d sends his
          messengers from on high to do good, but the intended
          recipients turn away to do evil, G-d will change the blessing
          into a curse so that His messenger shall not have been sent
          out in vain. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> Now the elders of Israel sinned, as Rashi
          explains in commenting on the verse (Exodus 5:1), "And
          afterward Moses and Aaron went" (</span>ואחר באו משה ואהרן<span
          class="c1">), because not wanting to appear with Moses before
          Pharaoh, they slipped away, one by one, from behind Moses and
          Aaron. The Elders were punished for this at Sinai as well,
          when only Moses was allowed to approach the Lord, but it was
          because of this sin that the Children of Israel were not
          redeemed immediately. For G-d turned the heart of Pharaoh
          against the Children of Israel and caused him to intensify
          their enslavement just so that Moses and Aaron should not have
          come before Pharaoh in vain. It was to this occurrence that
          the Midrash directed its words: "Hear, O My people, and I will
          speak" (</span>שמעה עמי ואדברה<span class="c1">). Even if I
          speak harshly to your enemy, be careful that you do not sin in
          the meantime and cause Me to turn my anger from your enemy
          unto you, so that my messengers shall not have been sent in
          vain. The passage "Eloqim Eloqekha anokhi" refers to Moses who
          asked profoundly "why hast Thou done evil to this people" (</span>למה
        הרעותה לעם הזה<span class="c1">) since he had been told "I have
          made you as a G-d to Pharaoh" (</span>נחתיך אלהים לפרעה<span
          class="c1">) meaning that Moses would be able to impose a
          stern judgment on Pharaoh. But instead, because of the sin of
          the elders that had occurred in the meantime, "I am your G-d"
          (</span>אלהיך אנכי<span class="c1">), meaning that mercy had
          been transformed into judgment. And to signify that a stern
          judgment was being imposed on the people rather than on
          Pharaoh the Scripture says, "and G-d spoke to Moses" (</span>וידבר
        אלהים אל משה<span class="c1">) rather than "and the Lord spoke
          to Moses" (</span>וידבר ה' אל משה<span class="c1">). </span></p>

    <div style="text-align: center;  padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2">
              וידבר משה כן אל בני ישראל ולא שמעו
          אל משה מקוצר רוח ומעבודה קשה. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> And Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel,
          but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken
          spirit and their cruel bondage (Exodus 6:9) </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> And below (Exodus 6:12) it says: "Behold, the
          people of Israel have not listened to me; how then shall
          Pharaoh listen to me" (</span>הן בני ישראל לא שמעו אלי ואיך
        ישמעני פרעה<span class="c1">). And many have asked in wonder,
          was it not because of their broken spirit (</span>קוצר רוח<span
          class="c1">) and cruel bondage (</span>עבודה קשה<span
          class="c1">) that the people of Israel did not listen to
          Moses? If so, how does their failure to listen to Moses prove
          that Pharaoh certainly would not listen attentively to his
          words? </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> And it appears to our master that the Sages
          say in the Midrash that the reason the people of Israel did
          not listen to Moses was because they did not want to turn away
          from idolatry. The Sages apparently inferred that this was the
          reason because Moses's words to the people of Israel began and
          concluded with the words "I am the Lord" (<span dir="rtl">אני
            ה'</span>). This suggests that the Scripture meant to say
          that they did not listen to Moses when he said "I am the Lord"
          and that they refused to accept the Deity. And the Scripture
          explains this refusal with the words "</span>מקוצר רוח<span
          class="c1">," which suggests that they did not listen to Moses
          because they were too ignorant and simple-minded to reflect on
          the Deity. And the word "</span>מעבודה<span class="c1">"
          refers to their worship of </span>בעל פעור<span class="c1">,
          and "</span>קשה<span class="c1">" means that it was difficult
          for them to separate themselves from their idol. Moses,
          therefore, was correct to say that if the people of Israel
          would not listen to me to believe in the G-d of their fathers,
          how would Pharaoh, who does not know G-d and has not heard of
          Him, listen to me?

    <div style="text-align: center;  padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2">
            ועתה שלח העז את מקנך ואת כל אשר לך
          בשדה כל שאדם והבהמה אשר ימצא בשדה ולא יאסף הביתה וירד עלהם
          הברד ומתו. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> Send therefore now, and gather your cattle,
          and all that you have in the field; for upon every man and
          beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be
          brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they
          shall die (Exodus 9:19) </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> It may be asked if G-d wished to kill them
          and to destroy them, why did He warn them that they should be
          gathered into their homes. If a man wishes to hit his friend
          with his fist does he tell him: "hurry, run away and hide from
          me"? </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> But it appears to our master that G-d only
          rained down hail and fire to destroy all their crops in the
          field to destroy their food supply and to cause them to perish
          of famine. The plague of hail was therefore more severe than
          any disease or any other plague that G-d brought upon them.
          Thus, Rashi comments on the verse (Exodus 9:14) "I will send
          all my plauges" (</span>הנני מביא את כל מגפותי<span class="c1">)
          that this plague outweighed all the other plagues. And the
          reason is because those who die by the sword are better off
          than those who die from hunger. So if most of the Egyptian
          cattle and much of the population of farmers and peasants had
          been killed in the field by the heavy downpour of hail, the
          hail would not have caused so great a famine, because the city
          dwellers would have been able to survive on the food remaining
          in the field after the hail had stopped. However, if the hail
          did not destroy the farmers or their cattle in the field, then
          the amount of food remaining would not be enough to support
          the whole population, so that many would then perish from
          hunger. That is why G-d said: "Send therefore now, and gather
          your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for upon
          every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and
          shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them,
          and they shall die." </span></p>
