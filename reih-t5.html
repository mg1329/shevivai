The verse begins with an imperative verb in the singular ("רְאֵה"
instead of "רְאוּ"), but then changes to a plural pronoun ("לִפְנֵיכֶם"
instead of "לְפָנֶיךָ"). The verse may be understood in the light of
what we wrote above (פרשת קדושים) in the name of our master about
the verse (Leviticus 19:18): "And you shall love your neighbor as
yourself" (וְאָהַבְתָּ לְרֵעֲךָ כָּמוֹךָ). For he explained that all the
good things and the blessings that the Eternal promised to Israel on
earth if they would keep His statutes and observe His laws, and all the
cruel punishments and every disease and every plague that He promised to
bring upon them here below should they not listen to His voice and not
walk in His ways - that He would give Jacob to destruction and Israel to
despoilers - those rewards and punishments pertain to the entire nation
and to people as a whole. But the Eternal does not repay any single
individual for his conduct here on earth, for individual reward and
punishment do not exist in this world (שכר ועונש פרטי בהאי עלמא ליכא).
And see פרשת קדוסדשים above. That is why the verse is written at
first in singular "see" (רְאֵה) for that blessing and curse, which I
place before you today (הַיּוֹם), while you are still alive, is for all
of you as a collective (לִפְנֵיכֶם).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
In this light we can also understand the Midrash Rabbah
This bears out what Scripture says (Jeremiah 13:15): "Hear and give ear,
be not proud, for the Lord has spoken" (שִׁמְעוּ וְהַאֲזִינוּ, אַל-תִּגְבָּהוּ:  כִּי
יְהוָה, דִּבֵּר). What is the meaning of "Hear and give ear, etc."? R.
Tanhuma said: "Hearken to the words of the Torah and speak not
haughtily, For the Lord has spoken [it]." And where did He speak it? [In
the words], "Everyone who is arrogant is an abomination to the Lord
(תּוֹעֲבַת ה' כָּל גְּבַהּ לֵב) (Proverbs 16:5).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
For this verse is referring to the individual (Deuteronomy 29:17-18) "a
root bearing gall and wormwood" (שֹׁרֶשׁ פֹּרֶה רֹאשׁ וְלַעֲנָה) who will
"bless himself in his heart saying: 'I shall be safe though I walk in
the stubbornness of my heart'" (וְהִתְבָּרֵךְ בִּלְבָבוֹ לֵאמֹר שָׁלוֹם יִהְיֶה לִּי
כִּי בִּשְׁרִרוּת לִבִּי אֵלֵךְ). As our master explained so
clearly in פרשת קדוסדשים, an individual who hears that he will not
be rewarded for his good deeds in this world may say to himself: "What
will I lose if I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, for no evil will
befall me?" But then the anger of the Eternal will be kindled against
that man, and against him alone, and the entire curse will lie upon him.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Thus, the Midrash quoted above concerning the verse "Hear and give ear,
be not proud" comes to teach us that one should not think arrogantly
that, because collective punishment is not administered to a single
individual inasmuch as only misconduct by the whole nation is subject to
Divine retribution in this world, he will escape punishment for his evil
actions. However, "everyone who is arrogant is an abomination to the
Lord." Thus, a completely self-centered person who says: "I and none but
I" (אֲנִי וְאַפְסִי), and "the whole world was created only on my account"
(וכל העולם לא נברא רק בגללי), who therefore does not care
about the destruction and the hurt that will devolve upon the nation as
a result of a multitude of sins, will kindle the anger of the Eternal
against himself. ודו"ק

You shall walk after the Lord your G-d, and fear
him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice

    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Rashi comments, based on the Sifri, that the words "and keep his
commandments" (וְאֶת מִצְו‍ֹתָיו תִּשְׁמֹרוּ) refer to "the Law of Moshe"
(תורת משה). Now the text of the Sifri interprets the words "You shall
walk after the Lord your G-d" (אַחֲרֵי ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם תֵּלֵכוּ) as a
reference to the positive commandments and the words "and keep his
commandments" as a reference to the negative commandments. But Rashi
combined the two together by saying that the entire passage including
"you shall walk after the Lord your G-d" is a reference to the Law of
Moses.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, we might also say that Rashi interprets "you shall walk after
the Lord your G-d" as a reference to the prohibition against
idol-worship, even if doing so has been granted special dispensation
(הוראת שעה) by the authority of a prophet concerning whom the
Scripture speaks above. Even if the prophet from among your brethren has
been confirmed, do not hearken unto him to follow false gods, even if
(as explained in the Gemara) an exceptional circumstance has occasioned
the temporary dispensation. At all times, you may walk only after the
Lord your G-d, and cling to Him and keep His commandments. Do not go
after a prophet who would ever seek to uproot entirely any of the
commandments of the Eternal. And the reason that the Scripture writes
"you shall keep" (תִּשְׁמֹרוּ) is that the commandments other than idolatry
are subject, under extraordinary circumstances, to special dispensation,
but may not be uprooted or invalidated altogether. For "keeping"
(שמירה) means that the commandment should at least be maintained as a
remembrance for the generations, even if we depart from one of them
temporarily at an extraordinary time when we must "do for the Eternal
and nullify His law" (עת לעשות לה' ויפירו אותה על פי נביא) at the
instruction of a prophet, as the Scripture tells us immediately
afterwards: "and hearken unto His voice" (וּבְקֹלוֹ תִשְׁמָעוּ).

In the Talmud (Hulin 16b-17a) there is a dispute between R. Yishmael and
R. Akiva. The opinion of R. Yishmael is that in the desert the
Israelites were forbidden to eat the meat of an animal not brought as a
sacrifice (בשר תאוה), and the opinion of R. Akiva is that even the
meat of an animal slaughtered through stabbing (נחירה) not just
through shehitah was permissible. The halakha accords with the opinion
of R. Akiva. But both agreed that the meat of an animal that was not
slaughtered (either through שחיטה or נחירה) was forbidden in the
desert, because even נחירה required that the windpipe and the gullet
be severed as the Tosafot write in many places in Hulin. So the question
arises why the Scripture did not record a commandment not to eat
נבילה until here in the Mishneh Torah (דברים) with no prior mention
at all in the first four books? And although there are several other
commandments that are mentioned only in the Mishneh Torah, the Ramban
writes at the beginning of דברים, that perhaps because these
commandments, like leverite marriage (יבום), divorce, slander 
(ומוציא שם רע), and conspiring witnesses (ועדים זוממין) were never (or only
infrequently) performed in the desert and therefore were not explicitly
recorded until here. But since the prohibition of נבילה was in effect
and occurred routinely in the desert, it is amazing that it was not
mentioned earlier. Moreover, the prohibition of טריפה is written in
the book of ויקרא, and נבילה and טריפה are really aspects of a
single prohibition, inasmuch as half an olive of נבילה and טריפה half an
olive of טריפה may be combined to constitute the minimum amount
required for punishment to be administered for consuming נבילה or
טריפה. So if the prohibition of טריפה was written in the first
four books, then why was the prohibition of נבילה not mentioned until
the Mishneh Torah? And a further difficulty is that here concerning
נבילה the Scripture writes "you may give it to the alien who is
within your gates (שְׁעָרֶיךָ) that he may eat it, or you may sell it to
a foreigner" which suggests that the prohibition of נבילה became
effective only after they entered the land of Israel since they had no
gates (שערים) and no resident aliens (גר תושב) in the desert.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Our master explains that this verse is therefore a clear and valid proof
to the second opinion in Rashi (Hulin 92b) that an animal that died of
natural causes is forbidden even to the Noahides. That is why נבילה
was not prohibited in the desert, because it really was not a frequent
occurrence, inasmuch as the meat of an animal slaughtered through
נחירה was permissible and was not considered נבילה, while an animal
that died of natural causes was prohibited even to the Noahides, so
there was no need for such meat to be specifically prohibited. However,
upon their entry into the Land of Israel, they were commanded to
slaughter only through שחיטה (subject to the five further 
הלכות למשה מסיני governing שחיטה). At that point, an entirely new
category of נבילה came into existence, namely the meat of an animal
slaughtered through נחירה or through a defective שחיטה (i.e., in
violation of any of the five הלכות למשה מסיני). Thus, it was
concerning this new type of נבילה that they were admonished in
דברים and they were further commanded to give the new category of
נבילה to the resident alien within their towns or to sell to a
foreigner. But any animal that had died of natural causes was prohibited
even to a Noahide and could not have been given or sold to a resident
alien or to a foreigner. (See the פתיחה to Dor Revi'i on Hulin,
sections I-III, where this insight into the dispute between R. Ishmael
and R. Akiva stemming from the prohibition of נבילה in this verse is
elaborated at length and provides the foundation for understanding the
entire tractate.)
