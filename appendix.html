    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> Our Sages warned against study of the Torah
          exclusively and exalted the importance of work, as we have
          been taught in Pirqei Avot (2:2): </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> Rabban Gamliel the son of R. Judah the
          Patriarch said: "Excellent is the study of Torah together with
          a worldly occupation, for the energy taken up by both of them
          keeps sin out of one's mind. And as for all the study of Torah
          where there is no worldly occupation the end thereof is that
          it comes to naught and brings sin in its train."
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> Moreover, we learn in Qidushin 29a that one
          who does not teach his son a craft is like one who teaches him
          brigandage, and our Sages taught us (Berakhot 8a) as well that
          a man who lives from the labor of his hands is greater than
          one who fears heaven. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> The various commentators endeavor to
          interpret the explicit and clear saying of the Talmud in
          Berakhot differently from its plain meaning. But their efforts
          were unnecessary, for the fear of heaven associated with an
          easy life is very far from being powerful enough to enable one
          to resist the evil inclination and sin. Nor does it preclude
          evil character traits. On the other hand, the expenditure of
          energy required by hard work distracts a person from his
          weakness and from his evil inclination and confers upon the
          worker a noble spirit, so that jealously and hatred, suspicion
          and oppression are hardly known to him. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> This lesson may also be learned from the sin
          and fall of Adam. At the commandment of the Almighty, blessed
          be He, Adam was prohibited, on pain of death, from deriving
          any benefit from the Tree of Knowledge. Adam, of course, was
          one who feared Heaven, but in the Garden of Eden he was idle.
          He was therefore unable to withstand the test, and ate from
          the fruit of the tree from which he was commanded not to eat.
          After sinning, in response to G-d's query, Adam said (Genesis
          3:12): "The woman whom You gave to be with me. She gave me
          from the fruit of the tree. And I ate." 
	  (<bdo dir="rtl">הָאִשָּׁה אֲשֶׁר נָתַתָּה עִמָּדִי הִוא נָתְנָה-לִּי מִן הָעֵץ וָאֹכֵל</bdo>)
          <!-- (האשה אשר נתתה עמדי הוא מתמה   לי מן העץ ואכל) --> The
          Midrash exlaborates on his answer as follows: </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> It was the woman that You gave to be with me
          that brought me to do this - that I ate from the tree. And I
          am not at all sure that I will not eat again. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> When the Holy One Blessed Be He saw that the
          fear of heaven, which, was surely one of Adam's attributes,
          could not save him from sin, He provided Adam with another
          means by which to avoid sin: hard work. For G-d said to him
          (Genesis 3:19): "from the sweat of your face you shall eat
          bread." </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> The saying of our Sages that one who lives
          from the labor of his own hands is greater than one who fears
          Heaven is therefore fully correct, for one who works is better
          protected from sin than one who fears heaven but is idle. </span></p>

	      </div>
           <div style="text-align: justify;">
              <p><span class="c1"> In my youth my father, my teacher, my
                  master, the gaon (R. Abraham Glasner 1826-78) often
                  told me not be proud of my success in my studies. He
                  used to say: "Know that it was your forefathers who
                  conquered the path before you. They labored and toiled
                  for your sake, and the Torah always returns to its
                  lodging place." In this way he explained the following
                  Midrash:
                </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> "The righteous flourish like the palm
                  tree and grow like a cedar of Lebanon" (<bdo dir="rtl">צַדִּיק
                    כַּתָּמָר פְרָח כְּאֶרֶז בַּלְּבָנוֹן יִשְׂגֶּה</bdo>)
                  (Psalms 92:13). These are the children of Levi. "They
                  are planted in the house of the Eternal" (<bdo
                    dir="rtl">שְׁתוּלִים, בְּבֵית יְהוָה</bdo>) (Id.
                  14). These are children studying with their teachers.
                  "They flourish in the courts of our G-d" (<bdo
                    dir="rtl">בְּחַצְרוֹת אֱלֹהֵינוּ יַפְרִיחוּ</bdo>).
                  (Id. 14). For they stand and serve in the courtyard of
                  the Holy Temple.
                </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> This Midrash tells us that the
                  children of Levi, who are sanctified in the womb
                  before their birth, easily rise to ever higher levels
                  without great effort or toil, and, even at a young
                  age, achieve greatness. But this is not so for one who
                  is not a Levite. A non-Levite will not be successful
                  without many years of toil, nor achieve greatness
                  until old age. This is what is meant by "a righteous
                  person will flourish like a palm tree." It refers to
                  someone who begins to advance at a young age and
                  quickly develops into a cedar of Lebanon (i.e., a
                  Torah scholar), so that even in his youth his name
                  becomes great. But only for the children of Levi is
                  this so, because, from conception, they are destined
                  for Torah scholarship, for they alone are "planted in
                  the house of the Eternal," and are devoted, even as
                  young children, to studying with their teachers.
                  Although they begin by studying in the house of their
                  teachers, the Levites are soon in the courts of our
                  G-d, flourishing in the performance of the Divine
                  service in the Holy Temple. They stand at the head of
                  the people, and from their mouths Torah is sought,
                  which is why they cause others to flourish (יפריחו). </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> So it was with Noah and Avraham. For
                  Noah, who was a descendant of righteous and upright
                  ancestors, Lemekh and Metushelakh, was called a
                  righteous man from the beginning of his life, indeed a
                  perfectly righteous man (וצדיק תמים). And it is
                  written, "Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord."
                  It was as if by chance that Noah found favor, for he
                  achieved righteousness with little effort or exertion.
                  However, Avraham, as the son of Terah, was required to
                  undergo
                  ten tests before the Blessed One could call him
                  G-d-fearing. </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> How sweetly may the words of the
                  Midrash at the end of porashat Noah be explained in
                  this manner: </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> R. Simon said the Holy One Blessed Be
                  He found three bargains (מְצִיאוֹת) in the world:
                  Abraham, David, and Israel. Abraham, as it is written
                  (Nehemiah 9:8): "and Thou didst find his heart
                  faithful before Thee" (וּמָצָאתָ אֶת-לְבָבוֹ נֶאֱמָן
                  לְפָנֶיךָ). David, as it is written (Psalms 89:21): "I
                  have found David, my servant" (מָצָאתִי דָּוִד
                  עַבְדִּי). Israel, as it is written (Hosea 9:10):
                  "Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel"
                  (כַּעֲנָבִים בַּמִּדְבָּר מָצָאתִי יִשְׂרָאֵל). The
                  other scholars asked R. Simon: "Is it not written
                  (Genesis 6:8): 'And Noah found favor in the eyes of
                  the Eternal'? He replied to
                  them: "He found, but the Holy Blessed Be He did not
                  find. </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> The meaning is clear. In Avraham, the
                  Holy One Blessed Be He found an unexpected bargain,
                  for in the Midrash the Sages say about him: "Who was
                  the one who was defiled and became pure? Abraham who
                  came from Terah." Similarly, who could have imagined
                  that David, who had a ruddy complexion, was derided as
                  the son of a maidservant, and a descendant of a
                  Moabitess who had been allowed to marry into the
                  nation only by virtue of a special halakhic inference
                  from the Scripture [ממואב ולא מואבית], would became
                  the singer of songs for Israel or the sovereign of
                  Israel? So David, too, was a bargain for the Holy One
                  Blessed Be He. And similarly Israel left Egypt into
                  the desert as if it were a foreign nation (am lo'eiz),
                  but soon (Psalms 114:2) "Judah became His sanctuary
                  and Israel His dominion" (הָיְתָה יְהוּדָה לְקָדְשׁוֹ
                  יִשְׂרָאֵל מַמְשְׁלוֹתָיו). The Sages in the Midrash,
                  therefore, make the following comment on the verse
                  (Exodus 13:17): "When Pharaoh let the people go" (
                  וַיְהִי בְּשַׁלַּח פַּרְעֹה אֶת הָעָם). </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> Who was it that cried "ווי"? [The
                  Sages understand the verb "ויהי to be an expression of
                  lament based on the first two letters which are
                  pronounced "vai" or "woe."] It was Pharaoh who cried
                  "ווי" upon seeing the people of Israel marching in
                  formation, traveling triumphantly to become a kingdom
                  of priests and a holy nation. </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> The Midrash compares the reaction of
                  Pharaoh to that of the owner of a field in which there
                  was a heap of debris which he therefore sold cheaply.
                  The buyer cleared the heap, used it for planting, and
                  eventually grew three myrtle trees. It was thus that
                  the Holy One Blessed Be He found a bargain in Israel.
                </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> The question why Noah, about whom it
                  is written that he found favor in G-d's eyes, was not
                  also a bargain for the Almighty is now easily
                  answered. For Noah did, indeed, find a bargain, since,
                  owing to his distinguished lineage, he found favor,
                  with no great effort of his own, in the eyes of G-d.
                  However, the Holy One Blessed Be He found no bargain
                  in Noah, for Noah, owing to the efforts of his
                  forefathers on his behalf, had already been destined
                  from conception to be a righteous and faithful person.

                  himself], "Shall I have passed through the place where
                  my fathers prayed [i.e. Mount Moriah] and not have
                  prayed too?" He immediately resolved to return, but no
                  sooner had he thought of this (מיד יהיב דעתו למיהדר)
                  than the earth contracted and he immediately lighted
                  upon the place [Mount Moriah]. After he prayed he
                  wished to return (באי למיהדר), but the Holy One,
                  blessed be He said: "This righteous man has come to my
                  habitation; shall he depart without a night's rest?"
                  Thereupon the sun set.
                </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> My father, my teacher, my master, the
                  gaon of blessed memory (R. Avraham Glasner, 1826-78)
                  explained that Jacob, who had been ensconced for
                  fourteen years in the academy of Sheim and Eiver,
                  longed to study the Torah so passionately that he
                  despised every worldly activity and complied only
                  grudgingly with the instruction of his parents that he
                  travel to Laban's house to marry because to do so
                  would require him to become involved in mundane
                  activities. So the Gemara tells us that after arriving
                  in Haran, having passed by, without pause, the Divine
                  mountain, the place dedicated to prayer by Abraham and
                  Isaac, Jacob said: "Would it have been possible when I
                  was immersed in the study of Torah in the academy of
                  Sheim and Eiver that I should have passed by such a
                  holy place without feeling its holiness?" Just because
                  he had just passed by Mount Moriah without feeling its
                  holiness, Jacob concluded that his decision to go to
                  Laban's house and to become occupied with mundane
                  matters was not correct, for that decision had already
                  shown its effect: to profane him and to separate him
                  from his attachment to what is holy. He therefore
                  decided to return to the academy of Sheim and Eiver,
                  because only there could he be "a plain man, abiding
                  in tents" (איש תם יושב אוהלים). For what would he
                  accomplish by engaging in worldly pursuits that only
                  detract from his holiness? It was just at that moment
                  that Jacob was miraculously transported back to Mount
                  Moriah and he prayed. When he finished praying, he
                  wanted to return (באי למיהדר) - return to the academy
                  of Sheim and Eiver! But he immediately fell asleep
                  there, because the sun had set (וילן שם כי בא השמש),
                  and the Holy One Blessed Be He then showed Jacob that
                  his decision to return to the academy was not correct.
                  For to separate oneself entirely from the matters of
                  this world and to be involved only in reflection is
                  not the function of man in this world. To be involved
                  in reflection only is the calling of an angel that has
                  no evil inclination. But a human being perfects
                  himself by living in a community and rejoicing, as the
                  Torah permits, in the temporal life. This is how one
                  can fulfill the commandment "to know Him in all your
                  ways" (בכל דרכיך דעהו), uniting thereby body and soul.
                </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> It was this message that was conveyed
                  by the dream: "and behold a ladder set up on earth"
                  (והנה סלם מצב ארצה). The ladder symbolizes man in this
                  world, the world of action, because, at each moment,
                  he is either ascending or descending, going either to
                  a higher level or a lower level. And although the
                  primary place and situation of man is on the ground
                  "מצב ארצה", his head may still reach the heavens
                  (וראשו מגיע השמימה), for one is required to use this
                  world as a preparation for the next one, as we are
                  told "prepare yourself in the vestibule so that you
                  may enter the banquet hall" (Avot 4:21). The phrase
                  "and behold angels of G-d going up and down on it"
                  (והנה מלאכי אלקים עלים וירדים בו) means that even
                  though angels at first stand on a higher level than
                  man, they may be surpassed by a complete person who
                  fulfills his obligation to know G-d in all His ways.
                  As the Gemara here (Hulin 91b) explains, Israel is
                  dearer to the Holy One Blessed Be He than the
                  ministering angels.
                </span></p>
              <p><span class="c1"> And should you say that this test is
                  too difficult, for who can survive a battle with the
                  evil inclination if he does not enclose himself within
                  the four cubits of the law, that is why Jacob was
                  shown that "the Eternal stood above him" (<bdo
                    dir="rtl">ה' נצב עליו</bdo>) - to watch over him.
                  When Jacob awoke he said, "how fearful is this place"
                  (מה נורא המקום הזה) by which he meant that this path
                  that he was directed to follow - to join the two
                  opposites in order to unify and perfect himself - is
                  awesome and perilous. And he continued, "this is none
                  other than the house of G-d" (אין זה כי אם בית אלקים),
                  which means that his ultimate goal must be to unify my
                  heart to my Heavenly Father, "and this is the gate to
                  Heaven" (וזה שער השמים), which means that the way to
                  achieve this goal is to follow the path on which I
                  have started to Haran - to marry a wife and to tend
                  the sheep of Laban. The path is awesome and perilous,
                  for who knows if I will be worthy of achieving my
                  goal. It was for this reason that Jacob made his vow,
                  which at first glance seems calculated and lacking in
                  trust in the Almighty: "If G-d will be with me, and
                  will guard me on this way that I go, and will give me
                  bread to eat, and clothing to wear, so that I come
                  again to my father's house in peace and the Eternal
                  shall be my G-d, then this stone which I have put for
                  a pillar shall be G-d's house: and all that Thou
                  givest me I will surely give the tenth to Thee." </span></p>

              <div style="text-align: justify;">
                <p><span class="c1"> The Tosafot write (Hulin 91b) that
                    the simple meaning of the verse is not that Jacob
                    took many stones which were miraculously combined
                    into a single stone, but that he took one stone from
                    the stones of the place. However, if that were the
                    proper interpretation, it would be difficult to
                    understand why Hazal deduced from the verse that all
                    the stones gathered into one place, and each one
                    said "let this righteous one lay his head upon me."
                    The most reasonable interpretation would have been
                    that he took that particular stone that he had taken
                    earlier, not that there had been a miraculous
                    combining of many stones. But it appears to me that
                    Hazal did not deduce that a miracle had occurred
                    because they saw any contradiction between the first
                    verse that refers to "stones" and the later verse
                    that refers to "the stone." Rather, they were
                    troubled that since there had been many stones
                    available, since it is written "he took from the
                    stones of the place" (ויקח מאבני המקום), why did
                    Jacob specifically take that stone upon which he had
                    laid his head, a stone that had been put to a
                    mundane use. It would have been more appropriate to
                    have taken a stone that had never been used by
                    anyone, which would be greater homage to Heaven.
                    They therefore deduced that the stones of the place
                    gathered together and were miraculously transformed
                    into a single stone, so that no others were left.
                    And the proof that this is so is that if the basis
                    for the deduction were, as is usually supposed, a
                    contradiction between the two verses, why was it
                    said that all the stones of the place gathered
                    together? Was it not Jacob who took some stones and
                    arranged them as a kind of border around his head,
                    as Rashi comments on the verse in the Torah. If so,
                    it was only those stones that had been selected
                    already by Jacob that were arguing. So it must be as
                    we have explained it that all the stones of the
                    place were arguing and were transformed into a
                    single stone. And according to the Kabbalists who
                    say that these stones were from the altar upon which
                    Isaac had been bound by Abraham, all the stones
                    desired that Jacob should lay his head upon them.
                    And one could say that Jacob was inspired to use
                    that stone as a pillar owing to his modesty, because
                    he did not believe himself to be sufficiently holy
                    for the stones to have been arguing for his sake and
                    that a miracle was then performed to transform then
                    into a single stone. He instead attributed the
                    argument and the miracle to the desire of the stones
                    to be part of the pillar that they anticipated that
                    he was going to set up.
                  </span></p>
                <p><span class="c1"> And with this Aggadah I would
                    explain in a pleasant way Jacob's words "and this
                    stone which I set up as a pillar shall be G-d's
                    house." See the commentaries of Rashi and the
                    Ramban. According to what has been said previously,
                    one could say that a pillar was prohibited when the
                    Torah was given, as it is written, "thou shalt not
                    set up for thyself a pillar" (לא תקום לך מצבה). But
                    the Sages said that although a pillar was beloved in
                    the time of the Patriarchs it was despised later,
                    because the idolaters prescribed it as the procedure
                    for offering sacrifices. But this is very difficult,
                    because the idolaters built so many altars, as it is
                    written "ye shall uproot their altars"
                    (אֶת-מִזְבְּחֹתָם תִּתֹּצוּן), (Exodus 34: 13) and
                    we see that Bilam built many altars, and the entire
                    procedure of offering a sacrifice was followed in
                    idolatry, as it is written "so that they should not
                    sacrifice further to the satyrs" (למען לא יזבחו עוד
                    לשעירים), and it is also written "and they will eat
                    the sacrifices of the dead and drink the wine of
                    their libations." So there was no difference between
                    our method of sacrifice and theirs except that they
                    were sacrificing to demons and not to the Deity,
                    while we were sacrificing to Heaven to the blessed
                    Ein Sof, and with the intent that was prescribed by
                    the Torah. If so, what was the difference between a
                    pillar and any other altar? But the difference, as
                    Rashi explains, between a pillar and an altar is
                    that a pillar is a single stone and an altar is made
                    up of many stones, so that, according to the
                    explanation that all the stones were combined into
                    one, the pillar that Jacob set up really had the
                    status of an altar, not a pillar, because it was
                    made up of many stones. Jacob therefore said, "this
                    stone that I have set up as a pillar will be fitting
                    to be the House of G-d even after the Torah is
                    given." And in truth, a pillar was always despised
                    by G-d, because of some hidden reason, but Jacob's
                    pillar was different because it was like an altar.

    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
It states in the Talmud (Hulin 139a)
Our Rabbis taught: It is written (Deuteronomy 22:6): "If a bird's nest
chances to be before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground." What
does Scripture teach thereby? But because it is also written (Id. 7):
"But you shall let the mother go, and take the young" 
(שַׁלֵּחַ תְּשַׁלַּח אֶת הָאֵם וְאֶת הַבָּנִים תִּקַּח לָךְ) I might suppose that one
should go searching over mountains and hills to find a nest, the text
therefore states: "chance to be," that is, if it happens to be before you.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
From here the Havot Ya'ir (responsum no. 67) concluded that even if one
does not want to take anything from the nest, there is an obligation to
send away the mother and to take the children, for the Talmud deduced
from this verse that "if a bird's nest chances to be before you" teaches
us that one is not obligated to go searching for a nest in the mountains
and hills in order to fulfill this obligation. And I am amazed, for the
deduction of the Talmud is precisely that the formulation "if a bird's
nest chances to be before you" teaches us that we do not say that there
is an unconditional obligation to seek a nest to be able to send the
mother away (as we might have thought from the repetition of the words
 שַׁלֵּחַ תְּשַׁלַּח ), so that only if it had not been written "if a
bird's nest chances to be before you" would I have concluded that there
is an absolute obligation to send away the mother and take the children.
But it was precisely to preclude this inference that the Scripture wrote
"if a bird's nest chances to be before you." Therefore, even if one
happens upon a nest, one is not obligated to send away the mother unless
he wants to take the children.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now the Havot Yair bases his inference from the Talmud that there is an
absolute obligation to send away the mother and to take the children on
the explanation of this obligation given by the holy Zohar, which is
that if the mother bird will be distraught and flies from one place to
another in search of her children, the mother's pain will arouse the
pity of the Omnipresent, blessed be He, on his children in exile. But it
is known that the kabalistic explanations are in many cases not in
accord with the halakhah, as I have previously shown you in connection
with the prohibition of the sciatic nerve (גִּיד הַנָּשֶׁה) which,
according to the Zohar, is intended to repair the transgression of Jacob
in marrying two sisters. For the sciatic nerve is one of the 365 sinews
of the body, which correspond to the 365 negative prohibitions listed in
the Torah. But this explanation accords only with the opinion of R.
Judah who holds that prohibition of the sciatic nerve applies only to
one of the sciatic nerves, but it does not accord with the opinion of
the Sages who hold that the prohibition applies to both sciatic nerves.
Similarly the kabalistic explanation for the tefilin to be worn on the
weaker (left) hand, because the left hand is next to the heart, does not
accord with the halakhah, because, according to this reason, a
left-handed person should also wear the tefilin on his left hand. But in
fact a left-handed person is required to wear the tefilin on his right
hand. And there are many other instances in which the kabalistic
explanation does not accord with the halakhah. And the opinion of the
Havot Ya'ir is also disproved by the Hidushei ha-Ran.

How then can we recite the blessing on the Torah who chose us from among
all the nations and gave us His Torah after He offered the Torah to
every nation and they all refused to accept it? Now the Sifri on this
verse adds the following details:
The descendants of Esau asked G-d, "What is written in it?"
G-d answered, "Thou shalt not kill."
They responded, "Our ancestor was a killer to the core of his being."
G-d then went to the descendants of Amon and Moav. They asked Him, "What
is written in it?"
G-d answered, "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
They responded, "Our ancestor was an adulterer to his core."
G-d then went to the descendants of Ishmael to offer them the Torah.
They asked Him, "What is written in it?"
G-d answered, "Thou shalt not steal."
They responded, "Our ancestor was a thief to the core of his being."

This Midrash is clearly amazing. For these three commandments were among
the Seven Noahide Laws, which they were already obligated to observe.
And see what I have correctly written about this verse in my book
Shevivei Eish (see next d'var torah). But it now appears to me as clear
as the sun that G-d did not speak to the ordinary people of the nations,
but to their most enlightened and upright sages. And they therefore
responded to Him wisely that they would not be able to accept the Torah
on account of those three commandments, because if the national scholars
would have the authority to interpret and derive these prohibitions, the
national spirit would lead them astray to permit what must be forbidden,
as it was said about R. Meir that he could give 150 reasons for the
ritual cleanliness of a creeping thing (שֶׁרֶץ).

And it is also written (Psalms 50:16-20):
But to the wicked G-d says: "What right have you to recite My statutes,
or take My covenant on your lips? For you hate discipline, and cast My
words behind you. If you see a thief, you are a friend of his; and keep
company with adulterers. You give your mouth free rein for evil, and
your tongue frames deceit. You sit and speak against your brother; you
slander your own mother's son. (מַה לְּךָ לְסַפֵּר חֻקָּי    וַתִּשָּׂא בְרִיתִי
עֲלֵי פִיךָ.   וְאַתָּה, שָׂנֵאתָ מוּסָר  וַתַּשְׁלֵךְ דְּבָרַי אַחֲרֶיךָ.
 אִם רָאִיתָ גַנָּב וַתִּרֶץ עִמּוֹ וְעִם מְנָאֲפִים חֶלְקֶךָ. 
פִּיךָ שָׁלַחְתָּ בְרָעָה   וּלְשׁוֹנְךָ תַּצְמִיד מִרְמָה.
  תֵּשֵׁב בְּאָחִיךָ תְדַבֵּר    בְּבֶן אִמְּךָ תִּתֶּן דֹּפִי)."

My father, the gaon of sainted memory (R. Avraham Glasner, 1826-78)
explained that the meaning of the verses is that our will is the source
of our understanding, so that a person's opinions are subordinate to his
will and his inclination. Thus, if a person's heart yearns for his
desire, he will easily find, while imagining that he is acting in accord
with the Torah, a vacuous argument on the basis of which to permit what
is forbidden. For the sake of his own desire, a crooked person can
easily find 150 reasons for the ritual cleanliness of a creeping thing.
Therefore, the verse "But to the wicked man G-d says: 'What right have
you to recite (לְסַפֵּר) My statutes?'" is referring to one who
interprets and derives the laws of the Torah for that is called "סַפֵּר"
as our Sages understood the verse "איה סופר" to mean "where is the
one who counts the letters of the Torah?" The subsequent words "or take
My covenant on your lips" mean that you have relied on the covenant
giving the Sages of each generation authority over the Torah, as it is
written (Exodus 34:27): "in accordance with these words 
(כִּי עַל פִּי הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה) I have made a covenant with you and Israel." And
you relied on this covenant to make invalid inferences from the Torah.
So G-d says: "I did not have you and those like you in mind when I made
the covenant, because you hate discipline, and cast My words behind
you." In other words, because your heart is inclined towards your own
desires and you despise moral instruction, you inevitably cast My words
behind you, in order that their interpretation not contradict your will.
You would even excuse theft and adultery. "If you see a thief, you are
his friend, and keep company with adulterers." Through your words you
cause calamities by permitting that which is forbidden. ("You give your
mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.") And you
slander the true sages of the Torah who are called the "sons of your
mother" (בני אמך), the children and the builders of your people
(בני ובוני אומתך).

The Gentile sages refused to accept the Torah, because they knew that if
the Torah were under their jurisdiction, the Torah would not be
protected from and safeguarded against misguided and invalid derivations
that would turn the laws and percepts of the living G-d into wormwood.
But G-d could be sure that He could give the Torah - some of it in
writing but most of it orally - to the children of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, sanctified from their origins in the character traits of their
holy ancestors, with no risk that the Torah would, Heaven forbid, be
perverted. It is for this reason that we recite the blessing "asher
bakhar banu mi-kol ha-amim v'natan lanu et torato," which means that He
gave us the Torah as a gift which became our possession to do with as we
please. [See also the explanation of the Dor Revi'i on the verse in
seder Ki Tisa (Exodus 31:18, "וַיִּתֵּן אֶל-מֹשֶׁה, כְּכַלֹּתוֹ לְדַבֵּר אִתּוֹ") 
(from the introduction to Dor Revi'i on Hullin)
[Note for a third interpretation of this midrash see the d'var torah on
Megilat Rut for Shavuot.]

Rabbi Juda Tzvi Glasner, grandson of the Dor Revi'i, asked the following
question. Why is this the only place in the entire Torah in which Moses
is referred to as "the man of G-d" (אִישׁ הָאֱלֹקִים)? He answers that a
leader must not separate himself from the people. He must be one of the
people, not a godlike figure above and beyond them. (See the Dor Revi'i
on סדר וילך). Thus, during all the time that Moses was the
leader of the Jewish people, the Torah emphasizes his human qualities.
Only at the very end, literally the last day, of his life, when his
leadership of the Jewish people is over, does the Torah refer to him as
"the man of G-d."
