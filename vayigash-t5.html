      <p><span class="c2"> Then Judah came near to him (Genesis 44:18)
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The Midrash Rabbah (Genesis 93) says: This
          refers to the verse (Ecclesiastes 7:19): "Wisdom strengthens
          the wise more than ten rulers who are in the city" 
	  (הַחָכְמָה תָּעֹז לֶחָכָם מֵעֲשָׂרָה שַׁלִּיטִים אֲשֶׁר הָיוּ בָּעִיר).
          As soon as he saw signs of Judah's anger, Joseph kicked his
          throne and it collapsed into a heap of pebbles. Judah tried to
          take out his sword from its sheath, but he could not do so.
          Judah said this one must be one who fears Heaven.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The connection between strength and wisdom is
          difficult to understand. And our master explained to us in the
          name of his father (R. Avraham Glasner, 1826-78), the gaon of
          blessed memory, that, after seeing signs that Judah was
          enraged, and hearing himself assaulted with words like those
          that Hazal attribute to Judah ("for you are like Pharaoh, just
          as Pharaoh decrees but does not fulfill" and "I will kill you
          and your master"), Joseph the righteous should have responded
          to him with the anger of a king, or the angel of death. For
          how could Judah have presumed in his heart to vilify him in
          his own house while he was sitting on his throne? But Joseph,
          in his great humility and wisdom, did not respond in kind, and
          endured insult and abuse until Joseph felt as if he were
          sitting on a pile of pebbles. And because Joseph silently
          listened to this insult and abuse, the anger of Judah abated.
          For how could anyone remain angry after seeing that the king,
          sitting on his throne, was quietly enduring his own
          humiliation and became mute. In his wisdom, Joseph thereby
          overcame his brothers who, according to the tradition of
          Hazal, had risen up together to destroy the entire city. </span></p>

	  But his brothers could not answer him, for they were
          dismayed at his presence (Genesis 45:3)
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> In the Midrash it is written: אבא כהן ברדלא
          said, "Joseph was the smallest of the children of Jacob, but
          his brothers could not answer him "for they were dismayed at
          his presence" (כִּי נִבְהֲלוּ מִפָּנָיו). When the Holy One Blessed Be
          He comes to reprove each of us as it is written (Psalms 50:21)
          "But I will rebuke you and set the matter before your eyes"
          (אוֹכִיחֲךָ וְאֶעֶרְכָה לְעֵינֶיךָ) how much more so will we be
          unable to answer because we shall be dismayed at His
          presence."
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> And it appears to our master that the most
          severe rebuke occurs when a person recognizes the greatness of
          G-d and reflects on His loftiness. For then he will quickly
          become ashamed and will run away to hide, because he will ask
          himself how a creature of dust and ashes created from the
          ground could dare to sin against the Lord of all creatures,
          the King of kings, the Holy One Blessed Be He. It will then
          not even be necessary to enumerate his sins to him as part of
          his rebuke. We see such rebuke when Joseph made himself known
          to his brothers and said, "I am Joseph." They were looking at
          him face to face, but then they had to hang their heads in
          shame, and could offer not a word in reply, because they were
          dismayed at his presence. אבא כהן ברדלא therefore deduced that
          when the Holy One Blessed Be He will come in all His honor and
          splendor and glory and will properly reprove each person -
          which means that He will reveal Himself to each person so that
          he will be able to recognize the greatness of the Blessed One
          - when He does so, each person will rebuke himself, as it is
          written, "I shall rebuke thee," because "I shall set" My honor
          and My glory "before your eyes." And with this you will be
          rebuked.

      <p><span class="c2"> Do not quarrel on the way (Genesis 45:24)

      <p><span class="c1">
          Rashi comments: "Do not occupy yourselves in halakhic
          discussions." Another explanation is: "Do not take long steps,
          but instead enter the town where you will spend the night
          while the sun is still shining."
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> And our master explains this symbolically
          (דרך רמז), based on the saying of Hazal that one should always
          incite the good inclination (יצר הטוב) against the evil
          inclination (יצר הרע). If the good inclination prevails, it
          is well. And if not, one should lead the evil inclination to
          the house of study. And if the good inclination has still not
          prevailed, one should recite the shema. And if the good
          inclination has still not prevailed, one should remind himself
          of the day of death. Now each of these methods for subduing
          the evil inclination is best used under different
          circumstances, because their properties are not identical. For
          example, studying Torah will not help one to overcome an angry
          disposition, because the study of Torah tends to arouse one's
          anger, as the Sages said, "the Torah is what is boiling within
          him" (אורייתא היא דמרתחא ביה). Similarly one who has a
          melancholy disposition will obviously become more depressed by
          thinking about his own demise. However, reciting the shema
          will distract a person from his worries, will remove jealousy,
          and will cause anger to be forgotten, because kriat shema will
          arouse a person to fear G-d and to accept whatever may befall
          him with love and resignation in accordance with G-d's will.
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> It is written above that Joseph said to his
          brothers (Id. 45:5): "Now therefore be not distressed, or
          angry with yourselves because you sold me here: for G-d sent
          me before you to preserve life" (וְעַתָּה אַל תֵּעָצְבוּ וְאַל יִחַר בְּעֵינֵיכֶם 
	  כִּי מְכַרְתֶּם אֹתִי הֵנָּה כִּי לְמִחְיָה שְׁלָחַנִי אֱלֹקִים לִפְנֵיכֶם). This seems amazing, 
	  for anger and sadness are conflicting emotions. And it seems to our
          master that this accords with those commentators that suggest
          that Joseph was unsure whether his brothers had yet conceded
          that he was worthy of ruling over them because he now occupied
          a greatly superior position to theirs and because he was the
          son of Rachel, the principal of the house (עקרת הבית) to whom
          leadership was befitting. If this was what they were thinking,
          then they were likely to be very remorseful that they had sold
          him into slavery. On the other hand, Joseph thought that they
          still might not accept his right to rule over them, in which
          case their anger would be intensified, because by selling him
          into slavery, they themselves had brought it about that he
          achieved greatness and had become the ruler of Egypt. Joseph
          also thought that some brothers might hold the first opinion
          and be remorseful while others held the second opinion and be
          angry. He therefore said, "be not grieved, nor angry with
          yourselves." Addressing those who might be sad, he said, "to
          preserve life" (כִּי לְמִחְיָה), indicating that what they had done
          turned out to be for their own benefit, so that they had no
          reason to be grieved. And addressing those that might be
          angry, he said "G-d did send me," so that the honor that
          Joseph achieved was the result of G-d's will. And who can
          contest G-d?
        </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> Now the Torah is called a "way" (דֶּרֶךְ),
          because, as the Sages say (קידושין דף ב ע"ב), it is written
          (Exodus 18:20) "and you shall make known to them the way in
          which they shall go" (וְהוֹדַעְתָּ לָהֶם אֶת הַדֶּרֶךְ יֵלְכוּ בָהּ). 
	  Death is also called "דֶּרֶךְ" as it is written
          (Joshua 23:14) "behold I am going the way of all the land" (וְהִנֵּה 
	  אָנֹכִי הוֹלֵךְ הַיּוֹם בְּדֶרֶךְ כָּל הָאָרֶץ). But the sun symbolizes the fear
          of G-d, as they say, "they shall fear you with the sun," for
          the sun, when it sets, bows down to its Master. This is what
          Joseph meant when he said to them. "Do not quarrel on the way"
          (אַל תִּרְגְּזוּ בַּדָּרֶךְ). He meant to say, "do not provoke your evil
          inclination with "דֶּרֶךְ" - neither by studying Torah, nor by
          thinking about the day of death, which are both called "בַּדָּרֶךְ".
          For neither one is an effective antidote either to anger or to
          melancholy. When Rashi commented on this verse "do not occupy
          yourselves with halakhic discussions," he was referring to
          Torah. And when Rashi commented "do not take long steps," he
          was referring to recalling the day of death - i.e., today here
          and tomorrow in the grave. Instead "enter the town where you
          will spend the night while the sun is still shining" which
          means: recite the Shema, which will arouse the fear of G-d
          within you as symbolized by the sun which sets in the evening
          as a greeting to its Master. So you should enter the city
          before dark and recite the Shema, and you shall be happy and
          it will be well with you. </span></p>
