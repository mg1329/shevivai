Among all the evidence that wise men have found to prove that the
Torah that Moshe gave to the Children of Israel was the Torah of the
living G-d and to cut off thereby the arms of the unbelievers who say
that Moshe in his great wisdom prepared it and composed it, this one
shines as bright as the dawn. If we study the laws and principles of
each state, we will find that the laws and statutes that the rulers
expound correspond to the beliefs and opinions of the inhabitants of
those states. Every nation enacts laws and statutes that correspond to
its opinions and general understanding. And only from a people who
themselves strive for a vibrant attitude and seek to advance forward in
step with enlightened understanding can a ruler emerge who will, based
on his lofty status and exalted understanding, reform their laws and
make them more just. Rulers and leaders only can lead their peoples to a
place towards which the spirit of the people wishes to go.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Consider a wise and understanding nation, like the people of France, who
are just in their hearts and who strive for the spirit of knowledge and
wisdom. Their freedom has given them just and liberal laws under which
they proceed methodically without disturbance. Their ways are ways of
pleasantness and their paths are of peace. But consider an insolent and
foolish nation, like the Russians, who dwell in the valley darkness. Who
could lead them in orbits of righteousness and under laws of freedom?
For they are insurgents against light and they will always stumble and
upset everything. They will live under laws that are appropriate to them
and to their status and opinions.

This was not how Moshe led our ancestors. For he did not provide them
with a legacy (מורשה) that was commensurate with their spiritual
level at that time, which was not a generation of enlightenment in
belief and understanding. Before the midwife could come to them 
(בטרם תבא אליהם המילדת), they had given birth to laws and statutes
that were exceedingly lofty and sublime. Were our ancestors not like
grapes in the desert or unripe figs in the summer? In the early times,
they went in darkness and worshiped mountains and brought human
sacrifices. It was a time when Jacob was small and very weak when they
left Egypt, where they had worshiped idols and devoted themselves to
every abomination. If so, how could anyone say that this degenerate and
degraded people could have called to life these upright laws - which
were as far from them as east from west? As heaven is higher than the
earth, so were the ways of the Torah above their ways, deeper than the
deep and wider than any ocean. So how could it have occurred to Moshe
when he took them out of Egypt to give this lofty and exalted Torah to a
foolish and ignoble nation, a generation crooked and perverse who knew
nothing but to serve Egypt by making bricks and mortar?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Is this not a sure sign and testimony that G-d sent him and that the two
tablets were made by G-d and the words were written by G-d? Was it not
for Torah that He established boundaries on the land and upon it that he
founded the entire world? And did He not willingly chose His people
Israel to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation? But He did not give
Israel His laws and statutes because Israel was already prepared for
them, and had already risen from below and dwelled on high and were
worthy of that reward. On the contrary, G-d sent His holy word to
correct the ways of His people and to purify them like pure silver to be
His chosen people forever more.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It was upon this idea that the Midrash (Midrash Rabbah 99) based its
interpretation of the verse (Psalms 68:17) "Why look ye askance, ye
mountains of peaks, At the mountain which G-d hath desired for His
abode? Yea, the Lord will dwell therein forever" 
(לָמָּה, תְּרַצְּדוּןהָרִים גַּבְנֻנִּים הָהָר חָמַד אֱלֹהִים לְשִׁבְתּוֹ אַף יְהוָה יִשְׁכֹּן לָנֶצַח).
According to the Midrash, Mount Tavor and Mount Carmel were disputing
between themselves, each one saying "the Torah should be given upon me."
Therefore G-d said to them "you are defective (גִבֵּן אוֹ דַק)(
Leviticus 21:20). The mountain that G-d desires for His abode is Mount
Sinai." The Midrash was suggesting that Mount Tavor and Mount Carmel, by
saying that G-d should give the Torah upon them, meant that the Children
of Israel were on too low a moral and spiritual level to be worthy of
receiving such enlightened laws. They were arguing that, before giving
the Torah to Israel, G-d should wait until they had gradually elevated
themselves morally and spiritually until they had reached the loftiest
spiritual heights. But G-d responded to them with a higher wisdom --
with the just words "גִבֵּן אוֹ דַק" (a dwarf or crookback). By this G-d
meant to say that the high-minded idea that He should wait till the
Children of Israel had raised themselves up to be worthy of the Torah
before giving it to them would never be realized because on their own
they would never reach that spiritual level at which the laws and
statutes of the Torah would be appropriate for them. Rather, the
mountain that G-d desired for His abode was Sinai, that is to say G-d
desired Israel even when they were at a lowly moral and spiritual level.
He therefore brought the Torah down to Mount Sinai to match the low
level of the Children of Israel, wanting His holy Torah would raise them
up and elevate their existence. And these statutes are of ancient days
created before there were mountains, and for their sake G-d created the
earth and its fullness, the entire world and its inhabitants.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The breaking of the tablets give testimony and proof that the Children
of Israel were unworthy of this Torah. For it is evident that while the
King and His party were occupying Sinai and He was giving His
commandments to His servant Moshe, the Children of Israel made the calf
and bowed down to an idol. So when Moshe came down from the mountain he
cast the tablets from his hands, saying "all Israel are apostates, how
can I give them this Torah?" It is clear that they were not worthy of
the Torah. And yet it was still given to them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is what was meant by "and in all the mighty hand . . . which Moshe
wrought in the sight of Israel" (וּלְכֹל הַיָּד הַחֲזָקָה וּלְכֹל הַמּוֹרָא הַגָּדוֹל אֲשֶׁר
עָשָׂה מֹשֶׁה לְעֵינֵי כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל). He received the Torah and the tablets and
then quickly thereafter he smashed them "לְעֵינֵי כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל". This
shows that "בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹקִים" - for the Torah, which is called
"רֵאשִׁית" G-d created the heaven and the earth. In other words, the
Torah was given before man became worthy of it, and it is by means of
the Torah that man slowly raises himself up. "For the land was unformed
and void" (תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ). While mankind were still dwelling in spiritual
darkness, G-d said, " יְהִי אוֹר".  G-d made the light of the
Torah shine for them. "For the commandment is a lamp and Torah is a
light" (כִּי נֵר מִצְוָה, וְתוֹרָה אוֹר).

Above we wrote how our master joined together, as if
by well-fastened nails, the end of the Torah to its beginning. And he
lifted his hand a second time to unite the structure to be a single
entity. The Rambam writes (פ"ח מהל' יסודי התורה הלכה א) that the children of
Israel did not believe in Moshe because of the signs and wonders that he
performed their eyes, for, inasmuch as such signs could have been
performed by means of secret arts, magic, and sorcery, anyone who
believes in signs is misguided. All the signs that Moshe performed were
required not to confirm the prophecy of Moshe but because of external
necessity. And they believed in Moshe only because they stood at Mount
Sinai and saw with their own eyes the glory of the Eternal and heard
with their own ears His words from the midst of the fire.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now in Bereishit the Ramban writes that the reason the Torah begins with
the words "In the beginning, G-d created the heaven and the earth," is
to teach us that anyone who does not believe that the G-d of the
Universe is the Creator of the mountains and the winds, but says that
the universe came first denies the most basic tenet of faith and denies
the Torah. Now one may ask that although we did indeed see with our own
eyes and hear with our own ears that the Eternal gave the Torah on Mount
Sinai, how can we know nevertheless with an irrefutable sign that He
created the world and conducts it. For there is no way for us to know
that He is the Creator except by seeing a miracle or sign that displaces
nature inasmuch as only the One Who has the capacity to control nature
and reverse the laws of creation could, as the philosophers and
scientists have written, have the capacity to create the world, so that
only that Being could be its Creator.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, when G-d descended on Mount Sinai enveloped in His Glory and
Majesty, and we heard His voice from the midst of the fire, and every
individual attained the paths of life and knowledge of G-d, they then
also understood that the Eternal is the G-d of the universe and that His
hand reaches the heaven. For the souls of all Israel together as one
were exalted up on high and they recognized at that moment the living
G-d and their eyes saw the glory of the splendor of His greatness.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now the signs and wonders that Moshe performed before Pharaoh and his
servants were performed only to show them that there is a G-d that
judges them in response to Pharaoh's question (Exodus 5:2): "Who is the
L-rd that I should hearken to His voice." And this is the meaning of the
verse: "for all the signs and wonders which the L-rd sent him to perform
in the land of Egypt." These were performed only for Pharaoh and his
servants and his people - that they should know that there is none like
the L-rd our G-d and that the land and its fullness belong to the L-rd -
but not for the children of Israel. The verse "and for all the mighty
power and all the great and terrible deeds which Moshe wrought in the
sight of all Israel" refers not to the signs and wonders in Egypt but
instead to the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai where they saw the G-d
of Israel revealed to them in all His glory and splendor and they all
heard His voice from the midst of the fire from which they understood
with perfect clarity that "in the beginning G-d created the heaven and
the earth." At that moment they knew well and understood that the
Eternal is the Creator of the heaven and the earth. And what need had
they for signs or wonders?
