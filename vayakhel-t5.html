The question arises what was it that the Eternal commanded to be done
(אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה ה' לַעֲשֹׂת אֹתָם), for the commandment is rather not
to do work on the Sabbath. And our Sages were aware of this problem and
therefore interpreted the verse as a reference to the work of the
Tabernacle, which is to be conducted on the other six days of the week,
but not on the Sabbath. However, why the Scripture writes "תֵּעָשֶׂה"
(shall be done) instead of "תַּעֲשֶׂה" (you shall do) remains unknown. And
perhaps the intention was to show that the work of the Tabernacle was
not really performed through the exertions of the workers, but that even
though their hands moved, the work was performed of its own accord, as
it is written (Exodus 35:31): "And He has filled him with the spirit of
God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in every kind of
workmanship."

And see Midrash Rabbah (Exodus 52:4)
When Solomon built the Temple everyone was helping him, including both
man and spirits, because it says (1 Kings 6:7), "For the house, when as
in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was
neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it
was in building.
(וְהַבַּיִת בְּהִבָּנֹתוֹ אֶבֶן שְׁלֵמָה מַסָּע נִבְנָה וּמַקָּבוֹת וְהַגַּרְזֶן כָּל כְּלִי
בַרְזֶל לֹא נִשְׁמַע בַּבַּיִת בְּהִבָּנֹתוֹ)" 
It was built of its own accord; therefore it must have
been built miraculously. Similarly, when the Tabernacle was erected, it
also rose up miraculously.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Nevertheless, the Scripture says not to do even such work (performed of
its own accord) on the Sabbath. And it appears to our master to say
simply that the Scripture is referring to a person who places his trust
in the Eternal, and his belief in G-d is so strong that he would not
perform any work had the Torah not commanded him "and you shall harvest
your crops" (וְאָסַפְתָּ דְגָנֶךָ), which means that even a person on this
level is obligated to conduct himself according to the normal way of the
world (הנהג בהם מנהג דרך ארץ), so that "I shall bless you in
all that you shall do" (וּבֵרַכְךָ ה"א בְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר תַּעֲשֶׂה). When the
Sabbath comes, rest comes to such a person, and he takes pleasure in the
Eternal with a generous heart and a willing spirit, because his faith in
the Eternal is strong, and although he rests from his work, he lacks for
nothing. Not so is the one whose faith in the Eternal is weak, and who
says in his heart: "my power and the strength of my hand have achieved
this wealth." Even if he does observe the Sabbath and does no work owing
to fear of punishment or to embarrassment before his fellow man, he
nevertheless will find no rest for his soul and his rest will not please
him because his heart is not in accord with his actions. This is the
meaning of "and these are the words" (אֵלֶּה הַדְּבָרִים), which,
according to the interpretation of the Sages, are the thirty-nine
categories of work "that the Eternal commanded to perform them" 
(אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה ה' לַעֲשֹׂת אֹתָם), because it is necessary to conduct oneself
according to the normal way of the world. It is therefore written "six
days shall work be done" (שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים תֵּעָשֶׂה מְלָאכָה). If you
shall work six days of the week only because G-d commanded you to
conduct yourself according to the way of the world, but had you not been
commanded to do so, you would not have worked because of the greatness
of your faith in the Eternal, then "on the seventh day there shall be to
you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to the Lord" 
(וּבַיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי יִהְיֶה לָכֶם קֹדֶשׁ שַׁבַּת שַׁבָּתוֹן) when you
observe the Sabbath in pleasure and great joy. And see in parashat Ki
Tisa on the verse (Exodus 31:15) "Six days may work be done but on the
seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest" 
(שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים תֵּעָשֶׂה מְלָאכָה וּבַיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי יִהְיֶה לָכֶם קֹדֶשׁ שַׁבַּת שַׁבָּתוֹ), 
Rashi comments: " a resposeful and complete, not a casual, rest" 
(מנוחה מרגוע ולא מנוחת עראי).

You shall

</span> (Exodus 35:3)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
Our Sages have already explained why this particular type of work
(kindling a fire) was enumerated. But it appears to our master to say in
an allegorical way that it is related to how the Sages interpret the
verse: "And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of
Israel" (וַיַּקְהֵל מֹשֶׁה) to teach us that they should come together in
gatherings on the Sabbath and Festivals. And these gatherings should be
holy convocations for the sake of the Eternal for Torah and for
testimony. But these should not be unruly gatherings for frivolous
purposes and dissipation that lead a person astray and ignite within him
his passions or stir up contentiousness and the fire of strife.
Therefore, after the Scripture commands them to call a halt to work on
the Sabbath, it says "you shall kindle no fire in your habitations upon
the Sabbath day." This is meant to teach us that the meetings in which
they gather together on the Sabbath should not lead them to kindle the
fire of jealousy and strife or to engage in any immodest conduct.
Instead the meetings should be a gathering for the righteous,
appropriate for them and appropriate for all.
