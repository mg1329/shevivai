          אבותינו ממצרים, הרי אנו וכו': </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt. And the
          Lord our G-d brought us out from there with a strong hand and
          an outstretched arm. And if the Holy One, blessed be He, had
          not brought our ancestors out of Egypt, then we and our
          children and our grandchildren would still be enslaved to
          Pharaoh in Egypt </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> Many have asked how we know that if the
          Eternal had not redeemed us we would have remained slaves to
          Pharaoh forever. And it appears to our master that although it
          was decreed at the Covenant Between the Pieces (</span><span
          class="c1">ברית </span>בין הבתרים<span class="c1">) that they
          be enslaved and afflicted and bear the unbearable Egyptian
          burden, it was not decreed that they become like slaves who
          had lost any feeling for freedom and liberty and who,
          preferring to serve their masters, had no desire to be
          liberated. As we wrote in poroshat Ki Tavo on the verse
          (Deuteronomy 28:68): "and there you shall offer yourselves for
          sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but none shall
          buy you" (</span>והתמכרתם שם לאויבך לעבדים ולשפהות ואין קונה<span
          class="c1">), this meant that anyone who would buy them would
          see that he had been mistaken, because they had not sunk to
          the level of slaves to have lost every elevated aptitude and
          faculty. However, our ancestors in Egypt were not wise and
          they lowered their heads to the ground, reaching the lowest
          level, that of a slave, utterly losing every advantage, every
          talent, and every lofty and honorable quality. They did not
          realize that they had lost all honor and that the crown, the
          majesty, the splendor, and the glory of any human being - his
          freedom - was missing. So low had they sunk that they would
          not listen to Moses and did not want to leave Egypt. Even
          after leaving, they repented of what they had done, and they
          said (Numbers 14:4) "let us appoint a chief, and let us return
          to Egypt" (</span>נתנה ראש ונשובה מצרימה<span class="c1">) and
          (Exodus 14:12) "for it would have been better for us to serve
          the Egyptians, than to die in the wilderness" (</span>טוב לנו
        עבוד את מצרים ממותנו במדבר<span class="c1">) and (Numbers 11:5)
          "we remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing" (</span>זכרנו

        את הדגה אשר נאכל במצרים חנם<span class="c1">) and many other
          statements like these. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The philosophers (</span>החכמים נבוני דבר<span
          class="c1">) have observed that whenever any right is forcibly
          taken from an individual, the individual will still retain
          some hope of eventually recovering that right. However, when a
          person surrenders and abandons his rights willingly, the
          person abandons all hope and will never recover what has been
          discarded. This is what is meant by "we were slaves to Pharaoh
          in Egypt." We sank to the level of a slave who is no longer
          even sensible of what he has lost and what he lacks. This went
          beyond what the Eternal had decreed which was only: "and they
          shall serve them" (</span>ועבדום<span class="c1">). That
          decree meant only that they should feel the servitude and the
          subjugation that would oppress them. But they should have
          longed for their salvation so that they might be liberated
          from the bondage of their souls. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The author of the Haggadah then brings a
          proof that our ancestors did not wish to be liberated: "And
          the Eternal our G-d brought us out from there with a strong
          hand and an outstretched arm" (</span>ויוציאנו ה' אלקינו משם
        ביד חזקה ובזרוע נטויה<span class="c1">). "An outstretched arm,"
          because our ancestors, having grown accustomed to the hard
          work and unable even to imagine anything better than their
          servitude, no longer wanted to leave. Only the Eternal, with a
          strong hand, could take them out of Egypt. So if the Holy One
          Blessed Be He had not taken us out of Egypt, we and our
          children and our children's children would still be slaves
          until this day, because our ancestors voluntarily and
          willingly gave themselves up to be slaves without even
          recognizing what they, as slaves, were lacking. </span></p>

      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> ואפילו כלנו חכמים כלנו נבונים כלנו
          זקנים כלנו יודעים את התורה. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> Therefore, although we were all wise, all of
          us knowledgeable, all of us elders, and all of us
          understanding the law. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The question arises why the "elders" are
          listed along with the "knowledgeable" (</span><span class="c1">נבונים</span><span
          class="c1">) and the "all of us understanding the law" (</span><span
          class="c1">כלנו יודעים את התורה</span><span class="c1">). For
          must not the "elders" (</span><span class="c1">זקנים</span><span
          class="c1">) that are mentioned here be understood to refer to
          the aged rather than to the "wise" (</span><span class="c1">חכמים</span><span
          class="c1">) who have already been listed? And a further
          question is: who are the "wise" and the "knowledgeable" (</span><span
          class="c1">נבונים</span><span class="c1">) that are listed
          here? They cannot be referring to torah scholars, for "those
          who are understanding of the law" (</span><span class="c1">יודעים



          את התורה</span><span class="c1">) are mentioned immediately
          afterwards. And if they simply refer to all those who have
          general knowledge and wisdom, what is the point of telling us
          that the obligation to recount the story of the exodus from
          Egypt devolves upon them? If they are not, in fact, torah
          scholars (who would be presumed already to be fully conversant
          with the story of the exodus), then their obligation should be
          no different from that of the rest of the people who are
          obligated to recount the story of the exodus. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> And it appears to our master that we already
          know that the tribe of Levi, who were the "</span><span
          class="c1">חכמים</span><span class="c1">" and the "</span><span
          class="c1">נבונים</span><span class="c1">," were not forced to
          perform hard labor (</span>עבודת הפרך<span class="c1">) with
          mortar and bricks in Egypt. Nor, because of their weakness,
          did the aged (</span><span class="c1">זקנים</span><span
          class="c1">) perform hard labor. Thus, the author of the
          Haggadah listed first those categories that were exempt from
          servitude and therefore performed no hard labor to teach us
          that even those categories of people who performed no hard
          labor are still obligated to recount the story of the exodus
          from Egypt. The author of the Haggadah then mentions the torah
          scholars to teach us not to think that since they already know
          the torah and know well everything that happened to us in
          Egypt, they, like everyone else, are obligated to recount the
          story of the Exodus. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right:
      50px;">
      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> כנגד ארבעה בנים דברה תורה וכו'. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> The torah speaks about four different
          categories of children. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> It may be asked why the Haggadah places the
          wicked son after the wise son but ahead of the simple son and
          the one incapable of asking. Is he not the worst one of all?
          It is also amazing that after the question "what is this
          service unto you?" asked by the son who is designated as
          wicked, the Torah says (Exodus 12:27): "the people bowed the
          head and worshiped" (</span>ויקוד העם וישתחוו<span class="c1">).



          Rashi comments that the they did so in gratitude for the good
          news that they would have further offspring. But how is it
          possible that they would rejoice on hearing of the arrival of
          a wicked son? </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> It appears to our master that just as it is
          not possible for the world to exist without both males and
          females, neither is it possible for the world to exist without
          both the righteous and the wicked. G-d created the one in
          relation to the other. For where there are shadows is there
          not light? And in the place of justice must there not be evil?
          Moreover, the perfection of the righteous will never be
          eliminated nor the folly of evil cease. However, from the
          manner of the wicked and their conduct we can infer the manner
          of the righteous and their conduct. For in a generation in
          which the wicked recognize in their souls the great loss that
          they have incurred by turning back from the service of G-d and
          how heavy is their sin for high-handedly transgressing the
          commandments of the Eternal, they will then seek to assuage
          their wounded spirit and to ease their minds by asking
          fallacious questions based on false opinions. They will pose
          questions and raise difficulties to our G-d to throw off from
          upon themselves the burden of their guilt and to relieve
          themselves of the yoke upon their necks. From these ingenious
          wicked ones we can easily judge the righteous. The wicked are
          a sign that the righteous desire the Torah of the Eternal and
          they study it day and night. And their wisdom resonates in the
          houses of worship and the houses of study for the sake of
          Torah, so that the whole land is filled with knowledge. The
          wicked must therefore seek to hide behind false doctrines. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> However, in a generation in which the wicked,
          unaware that they are sinning against their own souls,
          shamelessly throw the Torah and the commandments behind them,
          feel no need to excuse or justify their conduct or to offer
          wayward doctrines in their own defense. In such a generation,
          it is clear that the righteous and holy ones have been weak in
          upholding the Torah. Their skill has departed from them and
          they study the Torah indolently without passion, not seeking
          or searching. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> The four sons of the Haggadah therefore
          belong to and are the products of two different generations.
          In one era the wise son, desperate to know all the details of
          the commandments and all its derivations, asks "what are the
          testimonies, and the statutes and the laws?" (</span>מה העדות
        והחקים והמשפטים<span class="c1">). And in fact we answer him
          accordingly, for we tell him "concerning the laws of the
          Pesah: we do not partake of dessert after the Pesah" (</span>ואומרין



        לו כהלכות הפסח אין מפטירין אחר הפסח אפיקומן<span class="c1">).
          The commentators explain that this means that if your son is
          wise do not withhold what is good from him, but rather teach
          him all the laws of Pesah until the conclusion, which is that
          one may not partake of dessert after the Pesah, a law found at
          the end of the tractate of Pesahim (the last Mishnah
          discussing only rabbinic enactments). In such an era, the
          wicked will ask heretical questions, such as "what is this
          service unto you?" in order to find comfort for their impure
          souls for having despised the commandments of the Eternal and
          having defied His will. But if the righteous, like simple
          persons, ask only "what is this?" and are not desperate to
          master the entire contents of the Torah, and if their souls
          are not consumed by the desire to learn all the statutes of
          the Torah in all their detail and complexity, being satisfied
          with the mere general knowledge of "what is this?", then the
          wicked of that generation will totally disregard the
          commandments of the Eternal and will not even know that they
          are sinning. They will therefore not even feel the need to ask
          deceitful questions to put their own minds at ease. That is
          why when the Children of Israel were informed that in a future
          generation the wicked would ask "what is this service unto
          you?" they gave thanks to the Eternal for the good news that
          they would have truly righteous offspring, because if there
          were not truly righteous offspring, the wicked would not have
          asked such a question. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right:
      50px;">
      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> רבן גמליאל היה אומר בל שלא אמר שלשה
          דברים אלו בפסח לא יצא ידי חובתו וכו' שנאמר</span><span class="c1"> (שמות יב, כז)
	  </span><span class="c2">ואמרתם זבח פסח. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> See Tosaphot who wrote (פסחים קטז ע"ב ד"ה
          ואמרתם). The Scripture means an oral statement, so that one
          must say "this Pesah sacrifice that we are eating." And matzah
          and maror are compared to the Pesah sacrifice, so one must say
          "this matzah" and "this maror." </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> From their words it appears that in the
          Mishnah the proof text (Exodus 12:27) "that you shall say, It
          is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the
          houses of the children of Israel in Egypt" (</span> ואמרתם זבח
        פסח אשר פסח על בתי בני ישראל במצרים<span class="c1">)
          immediately follows the words "and they are these" (</span>ואלו
        הן<span class="c1">). Thus, according to the Tosaphot, Rabban
          Gamliel derives the obligation to say "this pesah" from this
          verse and then derives the obligation to say "this matzah" and
          "this maror" by comparison (הקש) to pesah. Thus, contrary to
          the author of the Haggadah, the proof text "</span>ואמרתם זבח
        פסח<span class="c1">" is sufficient for all three, because pesah
          is mentioned explicitly and the other two are deduced from
          pesah. However, the author of the Haggadah believed that the
          verse "</span>ואמרתם זבח פסח<span class="c1"></span><span
          class="c1">" was a proof text only for the obligation to say
          "this pesah." He therefore brought the proof text after
          writing: "This Pesah which our fathers ate in the Temple days,
          what was the reason for it? . . . as it is written.." The
          author of the Haggadah therefore required another proof text
          for matzah and for maror. </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> However, the words of the Tosaphot are
          correct and reasonable because the text of the Mishnah
          published in the Mishnayot does not bring any proof texts,
          while in the text of the Mishnah published in the Gemara these
          proof texts are written within parentheses. So the canonical
          text corresponds to the opinion of the Tosaphot that Rabban
          Gamliel brought the verse "</span>ואמרתם<span class="c1">" as
          a proof text for his main proposition that anyone who did not
          say these three things did not fulfill his obligation, not as
          the explanation for why the pesah is eaten. And some copyist
          who misunderstood how Rabban Gamliel derived his law from this
          verse must have inserted the verse "</span>ואמרתם<span
          class="c1">" below as a proof text for why the pesah is
          brought, and was then required to add other verses for matzah
          and maror. However, the correct reading accords with the
          opinion of the Tosaphot that immediately after "</span>ואלו הן
        פסח מצה ומרור<span class="c1">" one should insert the proof
          text, "</span>שנאמר ואמרתם זבח פסח<span class="c1">." </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> One may add a further proof to the words of
          Tosaphot to prove this derivation from this verse, for the
          verse "</span>ואמרתם<span class="c1">" is the answer that is
          written in the Torah to the question of the wicked son: "</span>מה
        העבודה הזאת לכם<span class="c1">" (what is this service unto
          you?). And to this question, the Torah says: "</span>ואמרתם
        זבח פסח<span class="c1">." The author of the Haggadah in fact
          ignores this answer and provides a different one (Exodus
          13:8): "because of that which the Lord did for me when I went
          forth from Egypt" (</span>בעבור זה עשה ה' לי בצאתי ממצרים 
	  <span class="c1">). For me, but not
          for him (</span>לי ולא לו<span class="c1">). And our master
          has previously elaborated on why it does not say "</span>ואמרתם
        לו<span class="c1">" (and you shall say to him) as it says in
          reference to the other sons, e.g., "</span>והגדת לבנך<span
          class="c1">" (you shall tell your son), "</span>ואמרת אליו<span
          class="c1">" (you shalt say to him). And from this difference
          in wording our master concluded that it is improper to respond
          to the wicked son with a curse, but only to respond by putting
          his teeth on edge by saying: "for me, but not for him." (And
          our master explained there how this answer is relevant to the
          son who is incapable of asking.) 
	  At any rate, the verse "</span>ואמרתם זבח פסח<span class="c1">" 
	  is not an answer to any questioner, in
          which case to whom should it be said if not to one's own son?
          Rabban Gamliel therefore properly deduces that even for one
          who has no son to question him, it is obligatory to say "this
          pesah." And as the Tosaphot wrote, R. Gamliel compared matzah
          and maror to pesah, so one is also obligated to say "this
          matzah" and "this maror." </span></p>
