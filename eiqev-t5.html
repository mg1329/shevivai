The question is obvious: why, if the Children of Israel observed the
laws that the Eternal commanded them, would their reward not be secure
even if the Eternal did not remember in their behalf the covenant that
He made with their forefathers?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">      
Our master "distilled his speech like the dew" 
(הטיף כטל אמרתו Deuteronomy 32:2) and explained the verse according to the Rambam
(הלכות מלכיס פרק ט הלכה יא) who said:
Everyone who accepts the seven Noahide Laws has a portion in the world
to come, provided that one accepts and performs them because the Holy
One Blessed Be He commanded to do so in his Torah. But if one performs
those commandments because of his own judgment, he is not a ger toshav
and is not included among the righteous of the nations.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Keseph Mishneh probes deeply to inquire from where in the Talmud the
Rambam deduced this. But our Master found a source in the Talmud (Avodah
Zarah 2b) where the verse (Habakkuk 3:6): "He looked and shook the
nations" (רָאָה וַיַּתֵּר גּוֹיִם) is explained as follows:
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
He saw that the nations did not observe even the seven precepts which
the sons of Noah had taken upon themselves, and seeing that they did not
observe them, He stood up and released them therefrom.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Gemara concludes that this means even if the Gentiles observe the
Noahide laws, they receive no reward for doing so. Now every intelligent
person must ask: if the fathers, not wishing to walk in His ways, sinned
and did not observe the seven Noahide laws, why should the reward of the
children who uphold those laws conscientiously be withheld? "Because the
fathers have eaten sour grapes, should the teeth of the children be set
on edge?" (Jeremiah 31:28) The Rambam, therefore, found it appropriate
to explain, in his wisdom, that the Gemara meant that in "releasing" the
Gentiles from the seven Noahide laws, the Eternal decided that the
Gentiles would not be rewarded for observing those laws if they did so
solely because of the dictates of their own judgment and reasoning. It
is only if they observe those laws because the Eternal commanded them to
do so that the Eternal will reward them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, that is not how Eternal conducts Himself with the Children of
Israel who are sustained by the merit of their ancestors. For even if
they observe His statutes and keep His laws only because of the dictates
of their own reason, should they still succeed in finding any reason to
observe His laws and statutes, the Eternal will not deny them benefit
but will give them their reward in the merit of their ancestors as He
promised them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now the word " עֵקֶב" (because) denotes a reason or explanation, which is
why the Scripture writes "וְהָיָה עֵקֶב תִּשְׁמְעוּן" (and because you will
give heed). Thus, even if you will observe these laws because of some
ulterior motive within you that causes you to observe and to fulfill
them, you will, nevertheless, still be able to partake of the reward.
And the Scripture then explains the reason: "the Lord your G-d will keep
with you the covenant and the steadfast love which he swore to your
fathers to keep." He therefore chose their descendants. And their
fulfillment of the commandments, whatever their intention in doing so,
will be meaningful and acceptable to Him.

And you shall eat
and be full, and you shall bless the Lord your G-d 
</span> (Deuteronomy 8:10)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
The Ramban wrote as follows:
when you will eat and you will be satisfied in this good land, you will,
as a result, bless the Eternal. However, the tradition of our Sages is
that the verse prescribes a positive obligation. And the meaning is
therefore: "you shall bless the Lord your G-d" (t'vareikh et ha-Sheim
Eloqekha) and this is similar to the verse (Deuteronomy 22:8): "you
shall make a parapet for your roof" (וְעָשִׂיתָ מַעֲקֶה לְגַגֶּךָ).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And our master says that the comparison between the two verses is not
accurate, because the latter verse begins "when you build a new house,"
so that it is clear that the remainder of the verse "v'asita ma'akeh
l'gagekha" ("you shall make a parapet for your roof" must be understood
as an imperative.) But here, the Scripture is providing a narrative of
future events after the entry into the Promised Land, so there is no
necessity to understand the verb "וּבֵרַכְתָּ" as an imperative 
i.e. תְּבָרֵ֪ךְ rather than as a simple foretelling of the future.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However our master says that the words of our Sages are "like nails
fastened" (Ecclesiastes 12:11) in a secure place and they properly
proved their interpretation, because after this verse, the Scripture
says (Deuteronomy 8:11-14): "Take heed lest you forget the Lord your G-d
. . . lest when you have eaten and are full . . . then your heart will
be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your G-d." Thus, from the
following verses it is evident that, by eating and becoming satisfied,
one naturally tends to forget, not to bless, the Eternal. So how could
the Scripture have contradicted itself by first foretelling that, after
eating and becoming satisfied, the people would be aroused on their own
to thank the Eternal but then immediately thereafter warn that if they
become well satisfied they should take care not to forget the Eternal?
The Sages therefore properly said that the verb "וּבֵרַכְתָּ" (you will
bless) must be understood as an imperative, as a Divine commandment of
the Eternal.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Why, then, did the Scripture not employ the imperative form (תְּבָרֵ֪ךְ)
instead of the declarative form (וּבֵרַכְתָּ)? The choice of the
declarative may be attributed to the desire of the Scripture to provide
a hint for the following saying of the Sages (Berakhot 20b):
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And shall I not lift up My countenance for Israel, seeing that I wrote
for them in the Torah, "and you will eat and be satisfied and bless the
Lord your G-d." and they are particular [to say the grace after meals]
if the quantity is but an olive or an egg.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Scripture therefore writes "you shall bless" in the declarative form
"וּבֵרַכְתָּ" to bear witness, as there is nothing for which no hint can
be found in the Torah, that in the future they will recite the blessing
also for a quantity of food (equal to an olive or an egg) less than that
over which they were Biblically obligated to recite a blessing. In this
light, we can explain away an objection that might have been raised: if
one is not obligated to recite a blessing, then it is a blessing in
vain. However, according to what we have said, since the Torah provided
a hint for the making of a blessing on a lesser quantity of food, such a
blessing is not a blessing in vain.

And now,
Israel, what does the Lord your G-d require of you, but to fear the Lord
your G-d, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the
Lord your G-d with all your heart and with all your soul       
</span> (Deuteronomy 10:12)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
See the Ramban who wrote that this entire passage is connected to the
end of the next verse which concludes "for your own good" (לְטוֹב לָךְלִשְׁמ).
But our Sages, as is well known, did not share this interpretation. And
it is obscure why, according to the Ramban, if it is all one idea, the
Scripture splits it into two verses. Moreover, why does the second verse
begin "to keep the commandments" (לִשְׁמֹר אֶת מִצְוֹת) instead of "and to
keep the commandments" (וּלִשְׁמֹר אֶת מִצְוֹת)?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It therefore appears to our master that the only reason that the Eternal
gave us His commandments and his laws, commandments pertaining to human
beings that are all concerned with the conduct of people made of earth,
was to straighten their ways and to "smelt away [their] dross as with
lye" (Isaiah 1:25) to bring them closer to the Eternal to worship Him
and to revere Him. "Out of them shall come the cornerstone, out of them
the tent peg" (Zechariah 10:4) with which to take and elevate these
clumps of clay so that they should love the Eternal and cling to Him.
These commandments are the very "top stone" (Zechariah 4:7) with which
to subdue our sensual nature and to cast off its yoke from upon our
necks. This is what the Scripture asks: "What does the Lord your G-d
require from you, but to fear the Lord your G-d . . . to love Him, to
serve the Lord your G-d with all your heart and with all your soul?" For
the desire of the Eternal and His longing when He gave us the Torah was
that it should purify human beings originated from dust and elevate them
to serve Him with all their hearts and all their beings. And the
Scripture says "in all His ways" to teach us that the duty of the heart
is to remove from within ourselves the heart of stone and to replace it
with a heart of flesh so that we may travel in the ways of the Eternal.
As the Sages said, just as He is merciful, so also should you be
merciful; just as He is gracious, so too should you be gracious. These
are the ways of the Eternal Being.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
But in the second verse, the Scripture is referring to those positive
commandments that a person must perform with his own hands, and to the
negative prohibitions from which one must turn away and stand at a
distance. The verse says: "to keep the commandments and statutes of the
Lord, which I command you this day for good," which means that the
Eternal enlarged and magnified the Torah with commandments governing our
conduct for our own good in order that we might more easily achieve our
ultimate goal to revere the Eternal and to love Him and to become
complete in our characters and our personalities. For these positive and
negative commandments will help you to purify and to elevate yourselves,
enabling you to revere and love the Eternal and to attain a lofty and
exalted character.
