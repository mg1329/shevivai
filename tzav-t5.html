Command Aaron
and his sons saying, this is the law of the burnt-offering
</span> (Leviticus 6:2)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
Rashi comments:
The word "צַו" (command) is nothing other than an expression of
exhortation. R. Simon said an exhortation is especially necessary when
there is the potential for an economic loss.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
See the Ramban who wrote that it was not in reference to this verse that
R. Simon made his comment, because under the law of the burnt-offering
(עֹלָה), the priest suffers no economic loss in bringing the offering to
the altar. On the contrary, the priest enjoys an economic gain from
bringing a burnt-offering to the altar, because the animal's hide
becomes the possession of the priest.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, our master says that the words of R. Simon were indeed based on
this verse and were built on a foundation of reason. For it is written
in the Midrash Rabbah (Leviticus 7:1) commenting on this verse.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is explained by the verse (Proverbs 10:12): "Hatred stirs up
quarrels" (שִׂנְאָה תְּעֹרֵר מְדָנִים).
The Midrash goes on to explain at length that the hatred that Aaron
aroused (see Deuteronomy 9:21) by making the Golden Calf provoked many
adverse judgments, and Aaron's name was therefore not mentioned from the
beginning of the book of Leviticus until this verse, except for verses
such as (Leviticus 1:8) "and Aaron's sons, the priests, will lay the
pieces" (וְעָרְכוּ בְּנֵי אַהֲרֹן הַכֹּהֲנִים אֵת הַנְּתָחִים). Only the
prayer of Moses succeeded in drawing Aaron close to the Eternal again.
It was, therefore, appropriate that the first commandment given to Aaron
after he was brought close should contain an admonition about the sin
that he committed.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Our master has already explained at length that the sin of the calf
occurred because the Israelites refused to listen to the voice of the
living G-d and because, despising the study of the Torah, they preferred
performing commandments at the instruction of mortals to learning the
commandments through the study of Torah. And Aaron, too, had held that
opinion. Thus, after Moses prayed to the Eternal in behalf of Aaron, and
G-d drew Aaron close to perform the priestly service before Him, G-d
taught Aaron that although He henceforward would desire burnt-offerings
and sacrifices, and those sacrifices would ascend in favor before Him,
nevertheless the lips of the priest should guard wisdom 
(שִׂפְתֵי כֹהֵן יִשְׁמְרוּדַעַת). It would be Aaron's responsibility to teach the people
that obeying is better than any sacrifice and acts of justice and
charity are preferred by the Eternal to oxen and bullocks. The people
would then learn to seek the Torah from his mouth and consequently would
not bring numerous sacrifices in order to eat meat, for study, which
leads one to perform good deeds, is greater than anything.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This is what was told to Aaron. "This is the law of the burnt-offering"
(זֹאת תּוֹרַת הָעֹלָה), "it is that [i.e., the law of the burnt-offering]
which goes up" (הִוא הָעֹלָה). For the essence of the burnt-offering is
the law of the burnt-offering. As our Sages say, whoever studies the law
of the burnt-offering, is considered by the Scripture to have offered
the burnt-offering. And, as we have written at length in poroshat
Vayiqra, the law of the burnt-offering is more sublime than the
burnt-offering itself.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
This admonition therefore required an added exhortation, because it
implied an economic loss to the Priests. For if they teach the people to
understand what the Eternal is asking of them, then the people, once
having understood that the true essence of the burnt-offering is the law
of the burnt-offering, would stop offering sacrifices. But if they do
so, then the Priests will forego the breast of waving 
(חֲזֵה הַתְּנוּפָה) and the thigh of heaving (שׁוֹק הַתְּרוּמָה).

And the fat of the beast that dies of itself, and the fat
of that which is torn by beasts, may be used in any other use; but on no
account shall you eat it. 
</span> (Leviticus 7:24)
</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
In the Talmud, it is asked why it is written here "on no account shall
you eat it" (וְאָכֹל לֹא תֹאכְלֻהוּ). For is it not prohibited to eat even
the fat (וְחֵלֶב) of a properly slaughtered animal, so why was it
necessary to mention that the fat of a beast that dies of itself
(נבלה) or that which is torn by beasts (טרפה) may not be eaten?
And in the Talmud they deduced what they deduced. There is, moreover, a
further question. Why is it written "may be used in any other use
(יֵעָשֶׂה לְכָל מְלָאכָה)? It should have said "a service may be
performed on it" (יֵעָשֶׂה בּוֹ מְלָאכָה).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And it appears to our master that although the Torah made it permissible
for work to be performed with heilev or for heilev to be sold, if the
hands of a person are constantly coming into contact with heilev, there
are grounds for suspecting that he may come to eat it. Therefore, anyone
that wishes to be involved in work that brings him into constant contact
with heilev, must first make it unfit for human consumption so that
there is no risk that he might eat it. Thus, in Pesahim 20 it is written
that they stored heilev in a disgusting container. Thus, the verse "the
fat of a the beast that dies of itself and the fat of that which is torn
by beasts may be used in any other use" means that one should render
such fat unfit to be eaten and fit only for the work to be performed on
it, so that "on no account shall you eat it."
