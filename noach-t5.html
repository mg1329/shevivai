	  Rashi comments: Some of our Sages understood this verse to
	  be praising Noah, inferring from the word "בדורותיו" (his
	  generation) that if Noah had lived in a generation in which
	  there were other righteous people, Noah would have been even
	  more righteous than he was in his own generation. But others
	  understood the verse to be denigrating Noah, inferring from
	  "בְּדֹרֹתָיו" that he was considered a righteous person in his
	  own generation, but if he had lived in the generation of
	  Avraham, he would have been insignificant by comparison. 
	  
  </span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
    
          The question arises, why does Rashi, in describing the first
	  view, say "if Noah had lived in a generation in which there
	  were other righteous people," and, in describing the second
	  view, "if he had lived in the generation of Avraham" instead
	  of repeating "if he had lived in a generation in which there
	  were other righteous people"?
	  
	  </span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
      
          And our master explained as follows. It says in the Midrash
	  that Noah was judged unfavorably because he did not try to
	  influence his contemporaries to repent of their wicked
	  conduct. The reason that he did not try to do so was that
	  his own faith was lacking, because his faith was merely a
	  tradition which he had inherited from his ancestors who had
	  been the righteous ones in every previous generation.
	  However, lacking that received tradition, he would have been
	  unable to recognize G-d with just his own knowledge and
	  understanding. Noah, therefore, was not brave enough to
	  challenge others in matters of faith, fearing that his own
	  faith might be compromised and that he might become, just
	  like his contemporaries, a man of deceit and corruption.
	  
	  </span></p> <p><span class="c1"> 
	  
	  Our first father, Avraham, was not like this. When he was
	  just three years old, he recognized his Creator. He was the
	  one who could see the Lord in a vision; he knew with
	  absolute certainty that a just G-d judges the land, and he
	  had no fear that he might be ensnared by the forsaken
	  opinions of his contemporaries. He therefore went out boldly
	  to do battle for G-d, winning many converts to G-d in Haran,
	  proclaiming, wherever he went, the name of the Lord, the
	  everlasting G-d.
	  
	  </span></p><p><span class="c1"> 
	  
	  Both of the opinions about Noah mentioned by Rashi referred
	  to this aspect of Noah's character. The opinion that
	  understands the Scripture to be praising Noah, because he
	  remained righteous in a thoroughly wicked generation,
	  believes that the Scripture wishes to tell us how much more
	  righteous Noah would have been had he lived in a generation
	  in which there were other righteous people who believed in
	  G-d. With their support, he would have dared, on G-d's
	  behlaf, to wage with a mighty hand a battle against the
	  wicked. He would not have been afraid of being ensnared by
	  their wickedness, because he could have relied on the
	  support of all the other righteous and holy ones of the
	  generation. The second opinion that understands the
	  Scripture to be denigrating Noah agrees that Noah would have
	  been an even greater person had he lived in a generation in
	  which there were other righteous people. But the second
	  opinion is drawing a contrast between Noah and Avraham. For
	  Avraham also lived in a generation in which everyone was
	  backsliding and there was no one else who acted righteously.
	  But, unlike Noah, Avraham went out singlehandedly to do
	  battle against the wicked, and risked his own soul in order
	  to cause others to repent and to teach them how to conduct
	  themselves.

         <div style="text-align: justify;">     
<p><span class="c1"> 
	  
	  Rashi comments: And concerning Avraham the Scripture says
	  "Whom I walked before" (אשר התהלכתי לפניו). Noah required
	  support to bolster him, but Avraham strengthened himself and
	  walked righteously by himself.
	  
	  </span></p> 
	  <p><span class="c1"> 
	  
	  It appears to our master that this is referring to the
	  Midrash that says that during the generations from Adam to
	  Avraham when mankind was sinning willfully, G-d was
	  continually withdrawing and distancing the Shehinah from the
	  world. Because of His anger at the oppressors who filled the
	  earth with violence, He removed Himself to the farthest
	  corner, the Seventh Heaven, and because of the evil that was
	  upon the land He rose to dwell in the highest abode. But
	  from Avraham to Moshe, G-d was bringing the Shehinah closer
	  to mankind and coming nearer to dwell on earth until He
	  finally descended upon Mount Sinai.
	  
	  </span></p> <p><span class="c1"> 
	  
	  According to this Midrash, the Scripture, in writing "את
	  האלהים התהלך נח" (Noah walked with G-d), was teaching us
	  that just as the Shehinah was rising ever higher and
	  departing from the earth, Noah, too, was distancing himself
	  from his contemporaries and dwelling alone, because he was
	  afraid to mingle with them lest he be influenced by their
	  conduct. But concerning Avraham the Scripture says: "אשר
	  התהלכתי לפניו" (Whom I walked before) because Avraham took
	  pride in saying that he walked in front of G-d to bring Him
	  closer to a rebellious mankind. Because Avraham admonished
	  them and led them to the wellsprings of belief, the Shehinah
	  eventually followed Avraham and returned to dwell on earth.

      <p><span class="c1"> 
      
          In the Midrash Yalkut it says that we praise a man partially
	  in his presence, but praise him fully outside of his
	  presence. This apparently means that above where the
	  Scripture is speaking about Noah (Genesis 6:8), it says "a
	  completely righteous person" (צדיק תמים) but here where G-d
	  is speaking directly to Noah, the Scripture says only "a
	  righteous person" (צדיק). 
	  
	  </span></p> <p><span class="c1"> 
	  
	  But our master explained to us in the name of his father the
	  gaon that the meaning of the Midrash can be understood in
	  relation to the fact that a human being is the composite of
	  a G-dly component from above and a parental component from
	  below. Compared to the component from above, a person can
	  never be called "complete," because in comparison to his
	  Heavenly likeness, he will always be found lacking. But if a
	  person is compared to his material component, he may be
	  called "complete in his actions" (תמים במעשיו). This is what
	  the Midrash means by the maxim "we praise a man partially in
	  His presence" (i.e., with comparison to G-d) because in
	  relation to Heaven ("צדיק לפני") a man is only a fraction of
	  what he should have become. But when the Midrash says "we
	  praise him fully outside of His presence" (i.e., in
	  comparison to his material component) it is referring to the
	  verse "These are the generations of Noah, Noah was a
	  perfectly righteous man in his generations," which speaks of
	  Noah's birth and ancestry. In comparison to his material
	  origins, as opposed to his heavenly component, Noah was
	  indeed completely righteous in his actions.
