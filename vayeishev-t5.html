  Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow
  ourselves to the ground before you (Genesis 37:10)

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  Rashi explains Jacob's response as follows: "Is your mother not long
  since dead?" Jacob did not, however, understand that the statement
  really alluded to Bilhah who had brought Joseph up as though she
  were his own mother. Our Rabbis inferred from here that there is no
  dream without some incorrect statement. Jacob's intention in saying
  this was to make his sons forget the whole matter so that they
  should not envy Joseph.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  Many have asked why in the first explanation Rashi says that Jacob
  did not understand that the statement really alluded to Bilhah. Was
  it not possible that, as the Rabbis explained, Jacob did understand
  that the dream alluded to Bilhah, yet wished to make his sons forget
  the whole matter?

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  Our master resolved the difficulty by explaining that the Rabbis
  based their interpretation that Jacob was trying to make the
  brothers forget the whole matter on the subsequent verse "but his
  father kept the saying in mind" (וְאָבִיו שָׁמַר אֶת הַדָּבָר). It
  appears from this verse that Jacob did believe in what the dream
  foretold. However, if one looks at the Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 84)
  from which Rashi took the first explanation, one sees that the
  Midrash interprets the words "but his father kept the saying in
  mind" to mean that Jacob was told via a Holy Spirit (רוח הקדש) 
  to keep the saying in mind, because the dream would come
  to pass in the future. The Maharaz writes there explicitly that the
  Midrash interprets the Scripture in this way, because it says "the
  saying" (הַדָּבָר) and not "the dream" (הַחֲלוֹם), which indicates
  that he kept in mind the instruction that G-d communicated to him.
  If so, it is not necessary to say that Jacob rebuked Joseph in order
  to make the other sons forget about the dream, because the reason
  that Jacob kept the saying in mind was that afterwards he was
  informed via a Holy Spirit that the dream would come to pass. On the
  contrary, because the dream was confirmed by the Holy Spirit, the
  dream had to be interpreted (by explaining that Bilhah was like a
  mother to Joseph) so that it should contain no incorrect statement.
  But our Rabbis, who deduced from the dream that there is no dream
  without some incorrect statement, must explain the words "but his
  father kept the saying in mind" according to its plain meaning. But
  in that case, how could Jacob have kept the saying in mind unless he
  knew that there is no dream without some incorrect statement? So he
  must have known that all dreams have some incorrect statement, and
  he rebuked Joseph only to make the other sons forget about the
  dream.

וַיִּמְצָאֵהוּ אִישׁ וְהִנֵּה תֹעֶה בַּשָּׂדֶה וַיִּשְׁאָלֵהוּ הָאִישׁ לֵאמֹר מַה תְּבַקֵּשׁ

      And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man
                                asked, "What are you seeking?" (Genesis 37:15)
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  Rashi writes that the man was Gabriel as it is written and the man
  Gabriel (וְהָאִישׁ גַּבְרִיאֵל). See how the Siftei Hakhamim proved that
  the word "אִישׁ" (man) in this verse could not be understood in its
  usual meaning, so that the Scripture must have been referring to an
  angel. But it appears plain to our master that the "man" had to be
  an angel, because Joseph was searching for his brothers and his eyes
  were seeking everywhere to find where they were tending the sheep.
  It therefore would have made more sense for Joseph to have
  approached the man to ask him whether he had seen his brothers than
  for the man to approach him. So the Scripture should have written
  "and Joseph found a man and asked him about his brothers." But the
  Scripture writes that the man found Joseph and engaged him in a
  conversation by asking him "what are you seeking?" (מַה תְּבַקֵּשׁ).
  Only then did Joseph ask him where they were tending the sheep. This
  proves that the man was an angel who saw, but could not be seen by,
  Joseph until he revealed himself by asking Joseph "what are you
  seeking?"

   וְהַבּוֹר רֵק אֵין בּוֹ מָיִם

The pit was empty, there was no water in it (Genesis 37:24)

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  The explanation of the masoreh is "for it is not an empty thing for
  you" (כי לא דבר ריק הוא מכם). And it appears to our master to
  explain this according to how the Sages explained "for it is not an
  empty thing for you." And if it is empty, they inferred, it is empty
  because of you, because you have not understood that it was a proof
  that only G-d can perform wonders. No one knows the extent of the
  wonders, for many times the one for whom the wonder has been
  performed is not even aware of a miracle. But one must believe that
  all the steps of a man are supported by G-d, and nothing is
  accomplished without Divine Providence. This is what was meant by
  the words "for it is not an empty thing." And if it nevertheless
  appears empty, it is only because of you that it appears so, because
  you are incapable of seeing clearly. But G-d's hand controls all.
  Now it was Reuben who suggested casting Joseph into the pit,
  intending to save him from his brothers and to return him to his
  father, because he thought that the pit was empty and no harm would
  befall him there. However, it was not so, because in the corners of
  the pit there were cobras and vipers that Reuben did not see, and it
  was G-d that saved Joseph from the snakes. And the brothers were
  unaware that a hidden miracle was being performed for Joseph. This
  is why the Masoreh said that it is not an empty thing from G-d, and
  even if it is empty, it is empty because of you who cannot see with
  your human eyes. But know that the hand of G-d has indeed done this.
  And the proof is that pit was empty without water, but it did have
  snakes and scorpions in it.
