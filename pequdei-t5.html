See Rashi's explanation of why the word "מִשְׁכַּן" (tabernacle) is
written twice. The word "מִשְׁכַּן" is mentioned twice in allusion 
to the Temple that was taken twice in pledge () by being destroyed twice for Israel's
transgressions.

The Midrash Rabbah (Exodus 51:1) says:
When R. Tanhuma began his dissertation [on this chapter] he cited
(Proverbs 28:20): "A faithful man shall abound with blessings; but he
who makes haste to be rich shall not be unpunished." You will find that
G-d always brings blessings by the hand of a man who is faithful
[trusted], but he that is not faithful and "makes haste to be rich shall
not be unpunished." "A faithful man" refers to Moses who was the
confidant of G-d, as it says (Numbers 12:7), "My servant Moses is not
so; he is trusted in all My house" (לֹא כֵן עַבְדִּי מֹשֶׁה  בְּכָל בֵּיתִי נֶאֱמָן הוּא). 
This is why [Solomon] said: "A faithful man shall abound
with blessings," because everything over which Moses was appointed
custodian was blessed, on account of his trustworthiness.



It appears to our master that the Midrash was also concerned with
explaining why the word "tabernacle" (מִּשְׁכָּן) was repeated. And so he
suggested that the source of blessing to Israel was that the Eternal
would dwell among them. The Scripture therefore says that upon the
completion of the tabernacle (Exodus 40:43), "Moses blessed them."
Rashi, quoting the Sifra, gives us the text of the blessing: "May it be
the will of G-d that His Divine Presence (שכינה) rest upon the work
of your hands" (יהי רצון שתשרה שכינה במעשה ידיכם).

The resting of the Divine Presence is a sign that those who built the
tabernacle did their work honestly. For in the Talmud the Sages say that
a thief is one who acts as if his actions were not seen on high, and
thereby causes distress to the Divine Presence [thereby causing the
Divine Presence to depart from him]. The Scripture therefore says that a
faithful man, i.e., one who deals honestly, abounds in blessings,
because he draws near the Divine Presence, which is the source of
blessings. This was a reference to Moses who faithfully supervised the
building of the tabernacle and all its vessels. This is what the verse
meant: "These are the sums of the tabernacle" (אֵלֶּה פְקוּדֵי הַמִּשְׁכָּן)
that Moses enumerated to ensure a just accounting. "The tabernacle of
testimony" (מִשְׁכַּן הָעֵדֻת) was itself testimony that Moses's
accountings were just, because G-d caused his Divine Presence to dwell
within the Tabernacle.
