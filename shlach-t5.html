Rashi comments:
There are countries which rear strong people and there are countries
which rear weak people.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
According to Rashi's comment, the end of the verse clarifies the
beginning. Whether the people dwelling on the land are strong or weak is
an indication of the quality of the land and whether the land produces
mighty inhabitants or weak ones. The Scripture mentions another sign
from which they could infer strength of the inhabitants: whether they
dwell in camps or in strongholds.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
Rashi explained this well, because each verse begins with words "and
what the land is" (u-mah ha-aretz).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
From here it is apparent that Moses sent the spies only to see that they
were going to inherit a beautiful estate - so that they should set their
hearts on it because of its productivity and goodness - for hearing
about the land is obviously not the same as seeing it. But he did not
send the spies to determine if they would be able to drive out the
inhabitants and take possession of the land, because that would have
shown a lack of faith in the Eternal Who had already promised to bring
them into the land. We can thus well understand the guilt of the spies
and the greatness of their sin in having changed their mission to
inspect the land to that of determining whether the Children of Israel
would be able to take it from the Emorites. In so doing, they
transformed a desirable quality of the land - that the people who
dwelled in it were strong and healthy and mighty - into an undesirable
one. And they said that we will not be able to stand up to the people,
because they are stronger than we are and because the Eternal is not
strong enough to bring us there.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
Understood in this light, how fitting are the words of the Sages who
said that Moses called Hoshe'a the son of Nun Joshua, as if to say may
G-d save you from the advice of the spies. Many have wondered why Moses
did not also pray on behalf of Caleb. And many pens have been broken
upon this point. However, according to the words of our master it is
properly explained, for Joshua also sent spies to gather intelligence
about how to conquer the land (and see the Malbim who proves from the
Scripture the difference between the spies (tarim) that Moses sent and
the spies (m'raglim) that Joshua sent. For the/tarim/ go to see whether
the land is good or bad and the /m'raglim/ go to find the secrets of the
land, where the most vulnerable point of attack is).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
Nor is there any mystery why Joshua thought it proper to risk the same
mishap that occurred with the spies of Moses, because Joshua was
motivated by a different idea. For Joshua, in sending spies, was simply
following the normal practice of the world. Although one should believe,
and place his trust, in the Eternal, one should, nevertheless, act in
all things in accordance with the ordinary way of the world and conduct
himself according to the laws of nature without relying on miracles,
because it is preferable to minimize miracles (ki l'ma'eit b'nisa
adiph). Therefore when Joshua approached the Promised Land, he sent
spies only to determine how to wage war against it, not to determine if
it would be possible to conquer the land.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
However, when Moses sent men to assess the land, the time had not yet
come to conquer it. He only wanted to know how good the land was. But
instead, those spies went out and searched it to assess whether they
would be able to conquer it. In so doing, they showed the weakness of
their faith in the Eternal and there was contempt and wrath in abundance.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
This is why Moses prayed on behalf of Joshua "may G-d save you from the
counsel of the spies." Moses meant that when Joshua would send his own
spies he should not do so with the same idea as Moses did, thereby
creating doubt in the promise of the Eternal. Rather they should just
search out the best path by which to reach the ultimate goal of
conquering the land in the natural way.</span></p></div>

      וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל מֹשֶׁה מוֹת יוּמַת הָאִישׁ רָגוֹם אֹת בָאֲבָנִים וכו'

      And the Lord said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death . . .
and they stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded
Moses. </span>(Numbers 15:35-36)          
	   </p>
    </div><div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> 
One may ask:
First, why did the Scripture write "the man shall be put to death" 
(מוֹת יוּמַת הָאִישׁ) and then "all the congregation shall stone him with
stones" (רָגוֹם אֹתוֹ בָאֲבָנִים כָּל-הָעֵדָה) which seems to be redundant.
And even according to Rashi who explained that they knew that he was
deserving of the death penalty, but did not know by which method to
execute him, there is still a redundancy. See the derivation of the
Sifri from this repetition.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
Second, why is the infinitive form "רָגוֹם" used, which Rashi
comares to "שָמוֹר" (to remember) and "זָכוֹר" (to keep). It is
difficult to understand why the infinitive form was used instead of the
imperative form "רְגוֹם".
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
Third, the Scripture writes, "And they stoned him and he died as the
Lord commanded" (וַיִּרְגְּמוּ אֹתוֹ בָּאֲבָנִים וַיָּמֹת כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה), 
but it would have been more appropriate to write "And they
stoned him as the Lord commanded, and he died" 
( וַיִּרְגְּמוּ אֹתוֹ בָּאֲבָנִים וַיָּמֹת כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
And it appears to our master to explain this according to the Midrash
(which is mentioned in the Tosafot, Bava Batra 119b s.v. aphilu) which
says that the one who gathered sticks did so for the sake of Heaven,
because our forefathers in the desert were misguided and said that after
the Eternal had decreed that they would die and be buried in the desert,
there was no longer any point in their observing the commandments and
laws of G-d. For what would they gain by doing so? The gatherer of
sticks therefore arose and sacrificed his own life to show them that the
word of G-d must be maintained forever even by them. So, according to
this Midrash, we can say that the Eternal, Who searches the heart of
every person, knew that this exalted man resolved to sacrifice his life
and accepted death in order to sanctify the name of G-d in the eyes of
the children of Israel. The Eternal, therefore, must certainly have
gathered in this pure spirit to Himself. Thus, the gatherer of sticks
expired and died before his body was shattered by stones, so that a
righteous person such as he would not suffer the cruel pain, even more
terrible than death, caused by stoning, the most severe method of
execution. The whole act of stoning was thus performed not to cause the
death of the man, but only to be witnessed by the children of Israel, so
that they should not continue to be sinful.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">  
That is why the Eternal told Moses "the man shall be put to death" 
(מוֹת יוּמַת הָאִישׁ). This man who is sufficiently exalted to be referred to as
"אִישׁ" will die first. Then the Scripture says "רָגוֹם", which is in the
infinitive form, meaning "to stone," by which the Scripture meant to
say, he will die first in order that he may be stoned without having to
suffer. And then the Scripture tells us that that is what happened, and
then "the whole congregation stoned him" (רָגוֹם אֹתוֹ בָאֲבָנִים כָּל-הָעֵדָה).
However, "he died as the Lord commanded Moses" 
(וַיָּמֹת  כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה  אֶת מֹשֶׁה), because he entrusted his spirit to the G-d of the
spirits of all flesh (אֱלֹהֵי הָרוּחוֹת  לְכָל בָשָר) before they stoned him.
