      <p><span class="c1"> In the Midrash it is written: What did Korah
          see that caused him to begin a dispute with Moses? He saw the
          chapter of the red heifer. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> This Midrash begs to be interpreted, and it
          appears to our master that Korah argued that since the whole
          congregation is holy and close to the Eternal, the people did
          not need the priests and the Levites to walk ahead of them to
          be ministers and judges and officers over them. It was,
          indeed, also the opinion of Moses, when he brought them out to
          the Mountain of G-d, to Horeb, that they should all be equals,
          a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, with no priest or
          leader to rule over them. However, the people refused to study
          themselves and did not want to hear the law and wisdom from
          the mouth of the Eternal, which was why they placed "נַעֲשֶׂה"
          (we will do) before "נִשְׁמָע" (we will study), because
          (Proverbs 24:7) "wisdom is too high for a fool" (רָאמוֹת
          לֶאֱוִיל חָכְמוֹת). So they made themselves a molten calf,
          saying "these are your gods, O Israel." For their souls
          desired abominations and a leader that would go before them
          and they after him, like an ox after his owner." (And see
          above פרשת תרומה and פרשת כי תשא where our master has
          elaborated on this.) </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> Now it is known that when the Israelites
          approached Mount Sinai their filth was terminated (פסקה
          זוהמתן) and they became immortal. However, when they turned to
          idols and they made an idol of gold, their filth was restored
          as before and their mortality was decreed for the generations.
          And it was concerning this that Asaph took up his song (Psalms
          82:6) "I said: you are like godlike beings" (אֲנִי אָמַרְתִּי
          אֱלֹהִים אַתֶּם), for you all would become like the gods that
          you wanted to go before you. And you would have been the
          leaders. "Nevertheless" (אָכֵן), when you chose iniquity and
          idols, the filth was restored, and therefore "you shall die
          like men" (כְּאָדָם תְּמוּתוּן). </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> In this light, we can understand the
          connection between the red heifer and the sin of the calf
          which occasioned the Midrash (Numbers Rabbah 19:8) "let the
          mother come and clear away the filth" (tavo imo v'tiqanah et
          ha-tzo'ah). For after the sin of the calf, G-d said (Exodus
          32:34) "and in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin
          upon them" (וּבְיוֹם פָּקְדִי וּפָקַדְתִּי עֲלֵהֶם חַטָּאתָם).
          And our master has already explained that the day of visiting
          (יום פקודה) is the day of death, as it is written (Numbers
          16:29) "and if they be visited after the visitation of all men
          (וּפְקֻדַּת כָּל הָאָדָם יִפָּקֵד עֲלֵיהֶם). So when each of
          the Children of Israel will die and his earthly sojourn will
          be remembered, he will cause the sin of the calf, which
          brought death back to the world, to be remembered as well.
          This is the meaning of "and in the day when I visit, I will
          visit their sin upon them." And that is why the red heifer,
          which purifies the ritual impurity of death, atones for the
          sin of the calf, which is remembered on the day that a man
          dies. והבן כי הדברים עתיקים.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> In the future, when the world will be
          perfected in the kingdom of the Almighty and He will execute
          the angel of death, the sin of the calf will be completely
          forgiven and will never be recalled or remembered again. In
          this light we may understand why the Sages of Secrets
          possessed of the Divine Secret wrote that in the future Korah
          will be vindicated in judgment and his righteousness will be
          clearly apparent. And they hinted at this because the final
          letters of the words "צדיק כתמר יפרח" (the righteous shall
          flourish like a palm tree) spell קרח (i.e. Korah). According
          to what was said, we can understand this very well, because
          Korah and Moses our teacher both held the same opinion before
          Israel committed the sin of the calf. If so, when the world
          will be filled with knowledge and the Eternal alone will be
          exalted, all Israel will be at the top of the stairs (</span>בגרם

        המעלות<span class="c1">), no princes will raise themselves above
          them nor kings reign over them. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> And these are the words of the Midrash. For
          Korah risked his life to differ with Moses, because he saw the
          chapter of the red heifer and from the multitude of ideas
          within him he believed that the heifer would cleanse
          completely the sin of the calf and transform entirely the
          spirit of impurity. He therefore stood up to argue with Moses
          and Aaron and said (Numbers 16:4) "for all the congregation
          are holy, every one of them, and why do you lift yourselves
          above the assembly of the Eternal?" </span></p>

    <div style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right:
      50px;">
      <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> וַיִּלֹּנוּ כָּל עֲדַת בְּנֵי
          יִשְׂרָאֵל מִמָּחֳרָת, עַל מֹשֶׁה וְעַל אַהֲרֹן לֵאמֹר אַתֶּם
          הֲמִתֶּם אֶת עַם יְהוָה </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"> But on the next day all the congregation of
          the people of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron,
          saying, You have killed the people of the Lord.</span>
        (Numbers 17:6) </p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> See the Ramban who explained that the people
          complained that Moses induced the assembly of Korah to offer
          strange incense as a result of which they died, even though
          the Eternal never commanded Moses to do so. They blamed Moses
          for not choosing a different sign by which to prove that Aaron
          was the holy one. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> Now one may ask why, indeed, did Moses act in
          this way towards those men. Why did he not choose a different
          sign? Is not the only reason for their death that they offered
          a strange incense? For it is written explicitly (Numbers
          16:35): "And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed
          the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense (וְאֵשׁ
          יָצְאָה מֵאֵת יְהוָה וַתֹּאכַל אֵת הַחֲמִשִּׁים וּמָאתַיִם
          אִישׁ מַקְרִיבֵי הַקְּטֹרֶת)." </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> And it appears to our master that the Malbim
          has explained that each of these quarrelsome men who were
          convened against the Eternal and His anointed one was seeking
          his own glory. And every one of them was driven by a spirit of
          dominion, each wishing to become priest or prophet. Korah
          thought that, as the son of Izhar, he was worthy of becoming
          king, while Dathan and Abiram felt that, as descendants of
          Reuven, the eldest son of Jacob, they were entitled to the
          birthright. And the two hundred and fifty men were princes of
          the congregation called into the assembly, men of renown, who
          were preeminent among the people. But none of them revealed
          his true desire to the other lest the package come unraveled,
          and everyone return to his own home. For why should one get
          angry in a quarrel that was not his? Each one, therefore,
          placed a mask over his true face by saying "all the
          congregation are holy," so that each one could be a priest in
          his own house, and each would help his friend and encourage
          his brother to take down Aaron from his position. But each
          one, in his heart, imagined himself, after Aaron was stripped
          of his position, as priest in Aaron's stead and as master over
          his brothers. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> However, the mightiest of the prophets
          understood the thoughts of these plotters of iniquity and
          wanted to undermine their plan, so he commanded them to offer
          incense. And although they planned a deception and spoke
          deceitfully, Moses thought that they would finally retreat in
          shame and each one would admit that he was seeking only his
          own glory rather than allow his allies to approach the altar
          to perform a service that would consume any layman who
          performed it. Why would anyone condemn his friend and
          colleague to death to be consumed by fire? Moses therefore
          expected that, as a result, all the workers of iniquity would
          be scattered (יתפרדו כל פועלי און). Instead, however, they
          stiffened their necks and defiantly approached to offer the
          incense. </span> </p>
