The Mishnah at end of Yoma teaches that one who says: "I will
transgress, and then I will repent; I will transgress, and then I will
repent" is not afforded by Heaven the opportunity to repent.
</span></p><p><span class="c2"> 
The Gemara
asks why one has to say this twice and as an answer the following saying
of R. Huna is cited:
R. Huna said in the name of Rav whoever transgresses a prohibition and
repeats the transgression a second time comes to consider the
prohibition as if it were permitted.
   </span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Rashi explains:
Since he transgressed twice, he is not afforded by Heaven the
opportunity to repent, because the prohibition seems to him as if it
were permitted.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
This is difficult to understand, because if one actively transgresses,
what difference does it make if he said that he will repent of if he did
not say he would repent? Either way, the prohibition now appears to him
as if it were permitted. Moreover, what is meant by the phrase "he is
not afforded by Heaven the opportunity to repent"? If the prohibition
appears to him as if it were permitted, he would not repent regardless
of whether Heaven affords him the opportunity?
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
It appears to our master that despite the words of Rashi that the Gemara
understood the Mishna to mean what it appears to be saying that one who
transgresses a prohibition twice with the intention of repenting is only
then not afforded the opportunity to repent. And the Gemara's question
was how is this different from the statement of another Mishnah that if
one says that he will transgress and Yom Kippur will atone, Yom Kippur
does not atone for his transgression? Thus, with regard to Yom Kippur,
one has to make the statement only once. The Gemara therefore asks why
it is necessary to say twice that one will transgress and repent before
he is denied the opportunity to repent.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
But in truth there is a big difference between the two cases inasmuch as
Yom Kippur comes automatically. For if we say that one who relies on Yom
Kippur to atone for his transgression receives atonement for the first
such transgression, then the strap would be untied, and everyone would
do what he wants with this assurance of atonement. However, if one
transgresses with the intention of repenting, repentance still does not
come automatically, but only if one resolves to repent and to sincerely
regret his transgression. And who knows if he will in fact repent?
Therefore not everyone will dare to sin with the intention of repenting
afterwards. But in that case, what is the difference between a person
who transgresses one time with the intention of repenting and a person
who does so many times? And why is the latter not afforded the
opportunity to repent?
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
The Gemara therefore concludes that the Mishnah was speaking about one
who wishes to perpetrate a deception, because he knows that by
committing a transgression twice he would view the prohibition as if it
were permitted and would not repent of such a transgression. Therefore,
he cleverly says that he will not transgress twice consecutively without
repenting in the interim, inasmuch as by doing so would prevent him from
subsequently repenting of the transgression. Instead, he will transgress
and will then repent immediately, so that it will be as if he had not
transgressed. Only then will he transgress, and it will not appear to
him as if the prohibition is permitted, because he will not have
transgressed the prohibition twice consecutively, the first having been
nullified by his repentance. Then, after the second transgression, he
will repent once again, so that he may transgress yet again. The Mishnah
teaches that Heaven does not afford him the opportunity to repent the
first time, since if he repents, he will transgress again. But if he is
unable to repent for the first transgression, he will be saved from the
subsequent transgressions.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
This is the answer of the Gemara citing the dictum of R. Huna in the
name of Rav that one who transgresses a prohibition twice considers the
prohibition as if it were permitted.. In other words, the Mishnah,
contrary to the initial assumption, is not referring to one who
transgressed two times with the intention of repenting. Rather, it is
referring to one who wishes to circumvent the dictum of R. Huna so that
the prohibition that he intends to transgress should not come to seem to
him to be permissible after the second transgression. He therefore says
in advance that I will transgress and then I will repent and then I will
transgress and then I will repent. Only in that case is he not afforded
the opportunity to repent for the first transgression. And this clear in
the words of the Gemara.

      <p><span class="c2"> 
The same Mishnah teaches that if one who says: "I will transgress and
Yom Kippur will atone," then Yom Kippur does not atone for him.
</span></p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1"> 
The
Gemara raises the question whether this Mishnah conflicts with the
opinion of Rebi who holds that Yom Kippur atones both for those who
repent and for those who do not repent. But the Gemara concludes that
the Mishnah need not conflict with the opinion of Rebi, because
"reliance is different." Rashi explains that if one actually commits a
transgression in the expectation that Yom Kippur will atone, Yom Kippur
does not atone in that case.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Now a scholar once asked our master why the Gemara did not use this
reasoning in the tractate of Shavuot (13) to answer the question how,
according to Rebi, it one could ever be subject to the punishment of
כרת for eating on Yom Kippur. The Gemara in Shavuot is hard pressed to
find an answer, but why did it not answer simply that, even according to
Rebi, one could be subject to כרת for eating on Yom Kippur in the
expectation that Yom Kippur would atone for the transgression? And our
master answered correctly that the question is not compelling. For if we
said that only one who ate on Yom Kippur in the expectation that Yom
Kippur would atone for the transgression, then there would have been no
point in mentioning that the punishment for eating on Yom Kippur is
כרת. Instead, the Scripture should have mentioned only the positive
commandment to fast (וְעִנִּיתֶם אֶת נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶם). And if the individual
would not be aware of the punishment of כרת, he would not come to the
point of saying "I will transgress and Yom Kippur will atone for the
כרת," since he would be unaware that eating on Yom Kippur subjected
him to a penalty for which he required atonement. Thus, if the
individual did eat on Yom Kippur, he would not be subject to the penalty
of כרת, because Yom Kippur would indeed atone for his transgression.
But it is surely impossible to say that the Scripture mentioned the
penalty of כרת for eating on Yom Kippur for no other purpose than to
impose it upon one who eats on Yom Kippur with the expectation that Yom
Kippur would atone.

      <p><span class="c2"> 
In the Mishnah at the end of Yoma, R. Akiva says, "how fortunate are
you, oh, Israel. Before whom are you being purified? Who is purifying
you? Your Father in Heaven, as it is written, 'and I will pour pure
water upon you, and you will become pure. From all your contaminations
and from all your abominations I will purify
you <br> (וְזָרַקְתִּי עֲלֵיכֶם מַיִם טְהוֹרִים וּטְהַרְתֶּם  מִכֹּל טֻמְאוֹתֵיכֶם וּמִכָּל גִּלּוּלֵיכֶם אֲטַהֵר
אֶתְכֶם).'"
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="c1"> 
Behold R. Akiva, after the Temple was destroyed and the
Sanctuary of the Eternal was burnt, sought to comfort Israel for the
loss of the Yom ha-Kippurim service which brought atonement through the
sin-offering (פַּר הַחַטָּאת) and the two goats (שְׁנֵי הַשְּׂעִירִם).
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
Behold there are two forces that upset our souls and, like a serpent,
wait along the way of the Eternal to cause us to do evil. First, desire,
the first sin, which leads us astray to do evil. Second, sustenance for
our lives, the burden of which is too heavy to bear and forces us to
depart from the way of the Eternal. Now when Israel dwelled upon its
land, the Holy Land, upon which the eyes of the Eternal are always set,
the desire to sin was not aroused to the highest degree. Nor did the
evil inclination exercise complete control over the Children of Israel
to push them away from the Eternal, because they dwelled in a place
consecrated to the Eternal. Moreover, "the atmosphere of the land makes
one wise" (ואוירא דארעא מחכים) and "the beginning of wisdom is the fear
of the Eternal" (רֵאשִׁית חָכְמָה, יִרְאַת  ה׳). They also found it
possible to support themselves more than adequately without excessive
effort and toil, because they dwelt securely in peace, each man under
his vine and fig tree. But in that ideal situation, any transgression,
any departure from the way of the Eternal to stand on the path of evil,
was very grave. It was therefore essential for them to perform on the
Fast Day both the sin-offering (חטאת) and the guilt offering (אשם) to
atone for their guilt, which was great.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
However, when the Children of Israel left their land and were exiled to
foreign lands, the evil inclination arose like an adversary to push them
off the way of the Eternal, because outside Israel his strength is
mighty and from his grasp none can be saved. As the Sages said, "whoever
lives outside Israel is like one with no G-d." Also their livelihood
provided them only with bitter herbs, for they had to devote their whole
lives to earn their bread. And it became very difficult for them to
observe the commandments of the Eternal. So for a loaf of bread a man
would sin against G-d and desecrate the Sabbath and His festivals and
would bear false witness against his friend. For who could bear the
shame of hunger and poverty? But for just that reason, their sins were
not too great to be forgiven, and the Eternal, in His goodness, would
forgive them when they returned to Him. But if we have neither Priest
nor altar to provide atonement, upon whom can we rely? On our Father in
Heaven Who acts toward us with kindness and truth.
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
This is what R. Akiva meant when he said "how fortunate are you, Oh,
Israel." Even though our city is desolate and our Temple destroyed, we
still have upon Whom to rely -- upon our Father in Heaven. In other
words, there is an atonement for our sins in that the Restorer of our
souls is now far away from us and has ascended to Heaven and does not
pour His spirit upon us -- "the blessings of Heaven above" 
(בִּרְכֹת שָׁמַיִם מֵעָל), by which we could understand and become wise and avoid
sin. Nor do we have the temporal blessings below, "the blessings of the
deep that coucheth beneath" (בִּרְכֹת תְּהוֹם רֹבֶצֶת תָּחַת), because all we
have left but is our bodies, and we eat bread only through the sweat of
our brow. But this withdrawal of the blessings, in itself, is an
excellent excuse for us, through which our sins are forgiven as if
through the service of Yom ha-Kippurim. And to reinforce his words, R.
Akiva quotes the words of the prophet Yehezkeil who, referring to the
bitter days of exile, said "And I will pour pure waters upon you, and
you will be purified. From all your contaminations and all your
abominations I will purify you." For the difference between
contamination (טומאה) and abomination (גלל) is that contamination is
invisible whereas an abomination is a disgusting thing that is visible.
These two words suggest the two types of transgressions mentioned above.
One who defiles his soul by eating food unfit to be consumed or by
having illicit relations is considered revolting in his person and his
soul as Tosaphot write in Hulin that it is exceedingly disgraceful to
eat something that is forbidden, because it disfigures his person. Thus,
our Sages say that an animal that was fed forbidden foodstuffs is
considered blemished and is unfit to be brought as a sacrifice. Such
transgressions are therefore represented by the word "גלל." But those
transgressions that, like the desecration of the Sabbath or swearing
falsely that are committed because of financial pressure, have an
advantage over the former class of transgressions in not defiling the
person of the transgressor. And the second group of transgressions are
represented by the word "טומאה" which suggests that these transgressions
have a less conspicuous physical effect. The words "and I will pour pure
water upon you" suggest that water will be poured from afar, from a high
place, "for I am in Heaven and you are in the land of your enemies. And
this itself is an excuse for you and therefore you will be purified of
all your impurities and from all your abominations."
</span></p>
      <p><span class="c1"> 
And R. Akiva mentions another advantage of the exile that did not exist
at the time of the Temple. "And it says again, 'the hope (מִקְוֵה) of
Israel, the Eternal, will save you in a time of peril,' just as the
ritual bath (מִקְוֵה) cleanses the unclean, so does the Holy One Blessed
Be He cleanse Israel." For the very fact that we have no one upon whom
to depend except our Heavenly Father will create the proper spirit
within us and will direct our hearts toward Him to serve Him, and all
the while Israel will look upward and subjugate their hearts to Heaven.
Now the purification of the ritual bath occurs when a person immerses
himself completely beneath the water and is completely separated from
anything else. So, too, Israel, when they have no one upon whom to rely
and no one to support them, and they just look toward G-d for mercy,
then will they be purified and their souls will be cleansed more than by
the guilt offering or the Scapegoat. For the Merciful One desires the
heart. And this is how the verse "Israel is saved by the Eternal, an
everlasting salvation." "Everlasting salvation" salvation means that we
may be saved in every generation even when Mount Zion is desolate
without worshipers to bring sacrifices their. In such times, Israel is
saved by the Eternal, and it is an everlasting salvation. That is what
is meant by "the hope of Israel is G-d" (מִקְוֵה יִשְׂרָאֵל ה'). Just
as a ritual bath cleanses when one immerses his entire body and is
completely surrounded by water, so the Holy One Blessed Be He cleanses
Israel when they look heavenward and their eyes are focused only on Him.
