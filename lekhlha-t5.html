    <p><span class="c2"> Go for yourself from your country, from your kindred and from your father's house
(Genesis 12:2)
 </span></p></div>

  The verse appears to be out of order, as it would seem more
  appropriate to have said "from your father's house, from your
  birthplace, and from your homeland." And it appears to our master
  that the order here was the basis for the Midrash Rabbah (39) which
  relates this verse to the verse in Psalms (45:11): "Listen, O
  daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget your own people
  and your father's house" (שִׁמְעִי בַת וּרְאִי וְהַטִּי אָזְנֵךְ  וְשִׁכְחִי עַמֵּךְ
  וּבֵית אָבִיךְ).  
  For an individual is apt to forget his
  homeland and the customs of his country before forgetting hסדis
  father's house.  The Scripture therefore writes: "Go for yourself"
  (לֶךְ לְךָ) so that you shall abandon and forget in the order of
  forgetfulness: first your country, then your kindred, and finally
  your father's house.

</span>></p>
    <p><span class="c1"> 

  However, according to Rashi, who explains that Avraham had already
  left his country, it must be that G-d commanded him to move even
  further away and to leave his father's house.  The order is
  therefore very correct, because Avraham had already left his country
  and had settled in Haran.  It was in Haran that G-d commanded
  Avraham to move even further away from his country and from his
  kindred, and, now that his father had settled in Haran, to leave his
  father's house as well. And see the Ramban.

</span>></p>
    <p><span class="c1"> 

  Our master also explained the reversal of the order in this verse in
  the name of his father the gaon (R. Avraham Glasner, 1826-78) as
  follows.  The Scripture was providing a reason why G-d commanded
  Avraham to leave his homeland when his great achievement had been to
  proclaim the name of G-d and to bring people closer to monotheism.
  For surely the most appropriate place for Avraham to reside in would
  have been in his native country where, according to the tradition of
  our Sages, he had miraculously survived being thrown into a fiery
  furnace.  However, someone who had been sent by G-d to admonish his
  contemporaries about their beliefs should first of all see to it
  that the members of his own household and his own family should also
  be inclining toward his beliefs and following in his path.  But if
  members of his own family depart from his ways and, ignoring his
  rebuke, betray him, the public will conclude that he is insincere. 
  For if he were sincere, how could his own household and his own
  family disregard his words?  We know that the members of the
  household of Avraham's father were wicked, and that Avraham's own
  brother Haran just stood by in detached silence when Avraham was
  confronting his contemporaries.  That is why the Scripture writes
  "go for yourself from you country" (לֶךְ לְךָ מֵאַרְצְךָ).  And
  the reason for going is to leave "your kindred and your father's
  house" (וּמִמּוֹלַדְתְּךָ וּמִבֵּית אָבִיךָ).  For you must depart from
  there, because your kindred and your father's house are impeding
  your mission, because their bad example prevents your words from
  making an impression on those who are distant from you.

             וַיַּעְתֵּק מִשָּׁם וכו' וַיֵּט אָהֳלֹה</bdo></span>
      </p><p><span class="c2"> And he moved from there . . . and
                                 pitched his tent (Genesis 12:8)
</span></p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> <p><span class="c1"> 
  Rashi comments that the text is written "oholah" (אהלה) even though
  it is read "אהלו" (his tent) to teach us that he pitched his wife's
  tent first and only then pitched his own tent.  The Siftei Hakhamim
  asks how Rashi knew that he pitched his wife's tent first.  And it
  appears to our master that since the text is written before it is
  read, Rashi deduced that he pitched her tent ("אהלה") first and only
  then pitched his own tent ("אהלו").  
</span></p>
<p><span class="c1"> 
  As the Siftei Hakhamim said Avraham accorded his wife greater honor
  than he accorded himself.  For even though Avraham presumably stayed
  in Sarah's tent until his own tent was pitched, he nevertheless
  acted deferentially toward her inasmuch as she was able to stay in
  her own tent all the while, but Avraham had to go from one tent to
  the other. 
</span>></p></div><div style="text-align: center;  padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
<p><span class="c2"> ולאברם היטיב בעבורה  </span></p>
<p><span class="c2">And he treated Abram well for her sake (Genesis 12:16)
</span></p></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> <p><span class="c1"> 
  Our Sages say that this teaches us that no blessing is found in a
  man's house except because of his wife.  But one must wonder whether
  there is anyone who would hope for a blessing such as this - to
  receive presents because his wife has been abducted from him.  And
  our master explained to us in the name of his father, the gaon, that
  the teaching must be deduced from the next part of the verse "and he
  had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and
  maidservants, and she-asses, and camels" 
  (וַיְהִי-לוֹ צֹאן-וּבָקָר, וַחֲמֹרִים, וַעֲבָדִים וּשְׁפָחֹת, וַאֲתֹנֹת וּגְמַלִּים). But the
  Scripture does not say that Pharaoh gave these to Avraham.  Nor
  would it have been the practice of a king to give presents in kind,
  but would only give gold and silver which would be readily available
  in his treasury. Where would Pharaoh have found the sheep and oxen
  to give Avraham?  We also see that Avimelekh gave Avraham a thousand
  pieces of silver after taking Sarah. In those days kings were not
  involved in working the land, so they did not have large quantities
  of cattle and servants at their immediate disposal. 
</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 

  So it is clear that Pharaoh gave Avraham a generous amount of gold
  and silver, and Avraham then gave the funds to his wife, the
  mainstay of his house, to do with as she saw fit.  He especially did
  so, because the funds came into his possession only for her sake.
  Now if Sarah our mother had preferred vanity and emptiness, or silk
  and embroidered clothes, or the finest serving dishes and utensils,
  all this wealth would have been quickly dissipated.  But she truly
  was the mainstay of the house, and so she used the funds from
  Pharaoh to buy servants and cattle that would enrich their owners.
  And this is what the Scripture meant by saying "and he dealt well
  with Avraham for her sake." In other words, Avraham was benefitted
  "for her sake" because of her and through her and Avraham was
  benefitted and blessed by the estate that he received from Pharaoh.
  And the Scripture goes on to explain that "he had sheep and cattle .
  . ." which means that the gold and silver that he received from
  Pharaoh were exchanged for cattle and sheep and servants, because
  Sarah did not squander his wealth on unproductive things.  Our
  Sages, therefore, understood the verse properly when they said that
  it shows that a blessing is not found in a man's house except
  because of his wife, for we see that, but for Sarah, even royal
  gifts would not have enriched Avraham.

 <p dir="rtl"><span class="c2"> 
    ואברם בן שמונים ושש שנים בלדת הגר את ישמעאל לאברם</span></p>
 <p><span class="c2">And Abram was eighty six years old, 
      when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram (Genesis 16:16)
</span></p></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> <p><span class="c1"> 

Rashi comments that this verse is written in praise of Yishmael - that
although he was thirteen years old when he was circumcised, he did not
resist.  And many have seen this and wondered, for is it not written
explicitly (Genesis 17:25) "and Ishmael his son was thirteen years old
when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin" (וְיִשְׁמָעֵאל בְּנוֹ
בֶּן שְׁלֹשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה שָׁנָה בְּהִמֹּלוֹ אֵת בְּשַׂר עָרְלָתוֹ)?  So why was it
necessary to provide yet another indication that he was
thirteen when he was circumcised?  

</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 

The Siftei Hakhamim answers this question in two ways: 1) Since his
age is mentioned twice, we may infer that Yishmael submitted to
circumcision, because G-d commanded him to do so and not because he
was afraid of his father; 2) the Scripture wanted to teach us that
Yishmael was exactly thirteen years old, and that this is the age of
adulthood for all Jewish males. 

</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 

Our master, however, rejected the words of the Siftei Hakhamim,
because that there was no need to repeat Yishmael's age to teach us
that Yishmael was exactly thirteen years old.  Once would have been
enough. Nor does the age of adulthood for Noahides depend on
chronological age, because no specific quantities were given to
gentiles.  Rather, we assess a person's judgment to determine whether
it has attained the level of an adult.  Nor is it correct, as the
Siftei Hakhamim maintains, that Yishmael willingly allowed himself be
circumcised to fulfill the commandment of G-d, because, as the Talmud
tells us (Sanhedrin 59b), Yishmael and Eisav were not included among
the progeny of Avraham.  The commandment to be circumcised, therefore,
did not apply to Yishmael.  Nor was he, even though the son of a
maidservant, considered to have been "born in his house" (יליד ביתו)
or "bought with his money" (מקנת כספו), because Avraham, before he
was circumcised, had the status, according to all opinions, of a
Noahide, and a Noahide cannot acquire a property right in the person
of a slave.  Therefore, if a Noahide has a son from a maidservant, the
boy has the status of a son, not of a slave, as our master has
explained well in his pamphlet "חקור דבר". Nor did Avrham have any
right to force his adult slaves to be circumcised against their will,
just as the slave of a Jew who has been acquired from a Gentile who
does not want to be circumcised cannot be circumcised, and may remain
in the household of the Jew for twelve months without being
circumcised, as the Talmud explains in Yevamot.  A Jew could
circumcise minor slaves born in his household (ילידי ביתו) or
purchased with money (מקנת כספו) only if their mothers gave their
consent for their sons to be circumcised to the בית דין since only
the beit din may authorize the conversion of a minor.

</span></p><p><span class="c1"> 

However, our master explained that what the Scripture wished to teach
us by indicating Yishmael's age twice was precisely that not only had
Yishmael reached the age of thirteen, but that he also had achieved
sufficient maturity to make his own decision for himself without
anyone else exercising control over him.  Nevertheless, he consented
to be circumcised with a willing heart and soul.  The Scripture
therefore writes (Genesis 17:23) "And Avraham took Yishmael his son,
and all that were born in his house" 
(ויקח אברהם את ישמאל בנו ואת כל יליד ביתו)  
- to teach us that he took them with words, as they say
about the verse (Numbers 16:1) "Now Korah . . . took" (ויקח קרח), that
he took them with words.  These were words of persuasion and
conciliation that induced all the adult males in Avraham's household
(באנשי ביתו) to enter into the covenant, for only an adult is called a
man (איש).
