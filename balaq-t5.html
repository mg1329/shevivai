Amorites. And Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were
many; and Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel.

One may ask the following questions:<b>1.</b> Why does the Scripture begin and
end by referring to Israel, but refer to "the people" (הָעָם) in between?
<b>2.</b> Why was it necessary to write both "Moab was in great dread"
(וַיָּגָר מוֹאָב) and "Moab was overcome with fear" (וַיָּקָץ מוֹאָב)?
What do the two verbs signify?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
And it appears to our master that our Sages observed that the Moabites
were not afraid that Israel might wage war against them, because Israel
had already been commanded (Deuteronomy 2:9) "Do not harass Moab, or
contend with them in battle" (אַל-תָּצַר אֶת-מוֹאָב, וְאַל-תִּתְגָּר בָּם, מִלְחָמָה). They were allowed, as the Ramban writes, only to confiscate
provisions from Moab. What, then, caused their great anxiety? The
Moabites had just seen what Israel had done to Sihon and Og, conquering
their lands even though, situated on the eastern side of the Jordan,
they had not been promised to Abraham's offspring. The Moabites,
therefore, were afraid that, the Children of Israel being too numerous
to be accommodated by the land of Canaan on the western side of the
Jordan, the Mixed Multitude among the Children of Israel would attack
Moab, conquer their land, and drive them from their homeland. They also
feared that the Children of Israel, while passing through their land,
would confiscate provisions from them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
The Scripture, therefore, writes that Balak saw all that Israel had done
to the Emorites. And even though Israel had been commanded by the
Eternal not to do the same to Moab, nevertheless, "Moab," as the
Scripture writes, "was in great dread of the people," in view of the
fact that the land of Israel was not spacious enough to accommodate both
Israel and the Mixed Multitude. Here "the people" refers to the Mixed
Multitude, because Moab feared that the Mixed Multitude would break off
from the Children of Israel to conquer the land of Moab and expel the
Moabites from their homeland. And the reason for the Moabites' fear was
"for they were many" (כִּי רַב הוּא), so that they could not all dwell
together in the land of the Canaanites. Besides their fear of the Mixed
Multitude, Moab was gripped by terror and dread that the Children of
Israel would launch raids against Moab to confiscate provisions, which
is why the Scripture also writes "and Moab was overcome with fear of the
Children of Israel."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
According to the explanation of Rashi, this verb (וַיָּקָץ) is the same
verb as (Genesis 27:46) "I am weary of my life because of the daughters
of Heth" (קַצְתִּי בְחַיַּי מִפְּנֵי בְּנוֹת חֵת). The verse is abbreviated as if
to say: "Moab was weary of life because of the Children of Israel." And
Moab said: "although I would rather live than die, nevertheless, I am
weary of a life in which there is no sustenance, for if they pass
through my land, and launch raids to take provisions, they will take the
bread from our own mouths."

Rashi comments:
לֹא תֵלֵךְ עִמָּהֶם  He (Bilam) said: If so, I will curse them in my
own place. Whereupon G-d answered: לֹא תָאֹר אֶת-הָעָם (you shall not
curse the people). He said to Him: If so, I will bless them. He replied
to him: They do not need your blessing, for they are blessed.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
See the Siftei Hakhamim. But he did not direct his comments properly.
And our master explains that Rashi commented that there was a
conversation between the Eternal and Balaam, because the Scripture did
not write "you shall not curse the people" with a conjoining "vav"
(i.e., did not write "וְלֹא תָאֹר אֶת הָעָם"). From this it is apparent
that not cursing them was a commandment separate from not going with
Balak's messengers. Moreover, if the Eternal closed the path to prevent
Balaam from accompanying the messengers, how could he then dare to curse
the people? Why then did G-d have to say explicitly "you shall not curse
the people"? That is why Rashi explains that, after being told not to go
with Balak's messengers, Balaam still wished to curse them in his own
place, so that G-d had to respond to him with the explicit commandment
"you shall not curse the people." For, in his towering arrogance, Balaam
thought that the Eternal had not allowed him to go with these men
because they were insufficiently important and distinguished for
Balaam's honor, but that he would have been allowed to go with a more
distinguished entourage than the one Balak originally sent. Indeed,
Balaam told them (Numbers 22:13): "the Lord has refused to let me go
with you" (מֵאֵן יְהוָה, לְתִתִּי לַהֲלֹךְ עִמָּכֶם). Did not Balaq
therefore send a larger and more distinguished delegation of ministers
after Balaam refused to return with the first delegation? When the
delegation from Balak came to Balaam, the Eternal, therefore, did not
say to Balaam that he should only go in the company of the kings and the
mighty ones of the earth. Rather, the Eternal had to tell him explicitly
that he should not go to curse the people. And see how the Ramban
explains why the Eternal was angered that Balaam went with the
delegation from Balak.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, Rashi's comment that, after being told not to curse Israel,
Balaam said, "if so let me bless them," is very obscure. How is it that
Balaam, an enemy of the Children of Israel, was suddenly transformed
into a loyal friend who wished to bless them? And it appears to our
master that it might be possible to answer in the light of the statement
of the Sages that the Moabites were not afraid that Israel would wage
war against them, because G-d had commanded Israel "Do not harass Moab,
or contend with them in battle." Israel had, however, been permitted to
confiscate supplies from the Moabites. And this greatly frightened Moab.
However, a nation would not conduct such raids unless it lacked adequate
supplies with which to support its soldiers. Balaam therefore said, if I
cannot curse them, then I will bless them, so that they will be wealthy
and will have houses filled with every good thing, in which case they
will have no need to launch raids against Moab.
