    Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make

  Our Sages deduced in the Talmud that when Avraham told Sarah to make
  cakes he instructed her to use "meal" (קֶמַח), and it was Sarah who
  said "fine flour" (סֹלֶת). From this textual deduction the Sages
  infer that women are disposed to be stingy with guests. But the
  obvious question is that if it was Sarah who, having been instructed
  by Avraham to use meal, took fine flour instead, then it was she who
  was the generous one.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
  In the Talmud the text is reversed to read that it was Avraham who
  said "fine flour" (סֹלֶת) and Sarah who said "meal" (קֶמַח). But our
  master says that the text in the Talmud reflects a mistaken
  correction by some student who wished to avoid the difficulty in
  attributing stinginess to Sarah if it was she who said "fine flour."
  This correction, however, only makes matters worse, because the
  Scripture itself writes: "and he said: 'Make ready quickly three
  measures of fine meal'" (וַיֹּאמֶר מַהֲרִי שְׁלֹשׁ סְאִים קֶמַח סֹלֶת).
  If we distinguish, in accordance with the derivation of our Sages,
  between the two words "qemah" and "solet," attributing one to
  Avraham and the other to Sarah, we are compelled to attribute the
  first, "קֶמַח," to Avraham and the second, "סֹלֶת", to Sarah. For
  how could one say that of the two words "קֶמַח" and "סֹלֶת"
  attributed by the Scripture to Avraham that the first was said by
  Sarah and only the second by Avraham?
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
  But our master resolved the difficulty by explaining that it would
  be incredible if someone as generous as Avraham, having slaughtered
  three bulls so that he could serve his three guests three tongues
  with mustard, would not have been willing to offer a little bit of
  fine flour and ordered that meal be kneaded instead? Moreover, why,
  in particular, did he say "make cakes" (עֲשִׂי עֻגוֹת)? Why serve cakes,
  instead of bread, with meat, butter, and milk, which are always and
  everywhere eaten with bread? But Avraham was moved by a different
  spirit, because he had just been informed by G-d that Sarah would
  bear him a son, Yitzhak, at the same time next year. (Genesis 17:22)
  He therefore feared that perhaps Sarah would immediately revert to
  her youthful state, resuming menstruation thereby rendering the
  dough ritually unclean, which, indeed, was just what happened. That
  is why Avraham commanded Sarah to take meal not fine flour. For
  according to the Talmud, fine flour cannot be made without being
  moistened, thereby becoming susceptible of ritual impurity. He
  further told her to make cakes, which would be moistened with fruit
  juice rather than water and, consequently, would not become
  susceptible of ritual impurity. He did all this so that there would
  be enough bread at the meal.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
  But Sarah ignored Avraham's instructions, and took fine flour. Why
  did she deviate from those instructions? If Avraham specified meal,
  how did she dare do differently? But having felt heaviness in her
  limbs, she knew that she would menstruate. So, understanding that by
  using fine flour for bread instead of meal for cakes, she would
  render the dough ritually unclean, she chose to use fine flour so
  that she could avoid giving the guests any bread. This is why the
  Talmud inferred that a woman is stingy with her guests.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
	 <p><span class="c1">
  Rashi explains that Avraham took three bulls in order to feed each
  guest tongue with mustard. And it appears to our master that the
  inference from the Scripture that Avraham served tongue is based on
  the Midrash Eikhah in which the knowledge of the children of
  Jerusalem is discussed. There was once someone who offered a perutah
  to one of the children to bring him the best available food. When
  the child brought tongue, he asked the child to bring the worst
  food. The child again brought tongue, explaining that if tongue is
  properly cooked and tender, there is nothing better than tongue, but
  if it is tough, there is nothing worse. And the Scripture writes
  here "tender and good" (רַךְ וָטוֹב) to tell us that it was good because
  it was soft. It is only tongue that has this characteristic. And
  there is nothing in the world for which there is not a hint in the
  Torah.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
 <p><span class="c1">
  Rashi comments that there are dots over the letters "א", "י",
  and "ו" in the word "אֵלָיו" to inform us that the angels had asked
  Sarah where is Avraham. And our master infers that they asked Sarah
  this question from the fact that by taking the letter "ל" which
  has no dot over it from "אֵלָיו" and adding it to the word "אַיֵּה," we
  get the word "אֵלֶיהָ" The verse can thus be read as 
  "וַיֹּאמְרוּ אֵלֶיהָ אַוֹי" (and they asked her where is he).

  And he said, "Lay not your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="c1">
  In the test of the aqeidah Avraham our father demonstrated two
  characteristics. First, he took his one and only son - the beloved
  of his soul and the child of his delight - who was dearer to him
  than anything else, to be slaughtered, to shed his blood like water.
  In doing so, Avraham showed the intensity of his love for G-d, so
  that he rejoiced in G-d's commandments even as one who finds a great
  treasure. Second, when the angel of G-d called to him: "Lay not your
  hand upon the lad," Avraham's response was amazing. He was then
  longing to sacrifice his son, and his love for the Almighty was
  burning inside him like a flame. Yet he withheld his hand from doing
  any harm to Yitzhak. This shows how great was Avraham's fear of G-d.
  It was mighty, because he stayed his hand from slaughtering Yitzhak,
  even though he had a great desire to sacrifice Yitzhak, for, as they
  say in the Talmud, Avraham asked if he could not at least inflict a
  wound upon Yitzhak, to effect at least a partial fulfilment of G-d's
  original commandment. Which is why the angel answered him "nor do
  anything to him" (אַל תַּעַשׂ לוֹ מְאוּמָה). For Avraham to have been able
  to rein in his desire to fulfill G-d's positive commandment at the
  moment of his greatest fervor showed an exalted fear of G-d that
  soared above even his love of G-d. And this is what was said: "For
  now I know that you fear G-d" (כִּי עַתָּה יָדַעְתִּי כִּי יְרֵא אֱלֹהִים אַתָּה).
  For you have reached the loftiest level of fear inasmuch as you did
  not withhold your one and only son from Me. And except for Me -
  because of the fear of the glory of G-d's greatness - there was
  nothing that could have prevented Avraham from performing the deed.
