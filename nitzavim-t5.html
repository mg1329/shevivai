An Agadic explanation: Why is this section (beginning with: "You stand
this day") put in juxtaposition to the curses in the previous chapter?
Because when Israel heard these ninety-eight curses besides the
forty-nine that are contained in תורת כהנים (Leviticus 26), they
became pale and asked in despair, "who can withstand all these?" Moses
therefore began to soothe them by saying "You stand this day" 
(אַתֶּם נִצָּבִים הַיּוֹם).</span></p><p><span class="c1">
But this explanation is difficult. Are the punishments mentioned in the
previous chapter simply a matter of partiality or favoritism? And it
appears to our master that an explanation may be found in the comment of
the Ba'al ha-Turim:
"you stand" (אַתֶּם נִצָּבִים) just as it is written (Exodus 19:17) "and
they stood beneath the mountain" (וַיִּתְיַצְּבוּ בְּתַחְתִּית הָהָר).
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Now, in the Talmud (Shabbat 88a) the Sages explain that this verse
teaches us that the Almighty inverted the mountain (Sinai) over them
like a cask and said, "if you accept the Torah, it is well, if not,
there shall be your buria." They also said there that this verse
furnishes a strong protest against the Torah (inasmuch as it was
originally accepted under duress). Thus, when the Midrash says that
Moses soothed them by saying "you stand here this day," he meant that
since they had not willingly accepted the Torah, it was as if they were
still standing beneath the mountain and were under duress. So if they
did not observe the Torah, and were in jeopardy of the curses, they
could be still excuse themselves, because they had never willingly
agreed to accept the Torah.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
Alternatively, one could explain the verb "standing" (נִצָּבִים)
according to the explanation of the עקידת יצחק, that although each
individual has the choice to follow the desire of his soul, the entire
nation of Israel can never discard the yoke of the Torah, and the whole
people cannot chose to depart from the paths of uprightness and follow
the stubbornness of their heart. For should the entire nation of Israel
stand upon a path that is not good and wish to do what is evil in the
eyes of the Eternal and to despise the Holy One of Israel, He will
install a harsh ruler like Haman, so that they will be moved to repent
from their evil ways. It was in reference to this idea that it is
written (Ezekiel 20:33): "As I live, says the Lord G-d, surely with a
mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I
will be king over you." And this is lesson of the verse "you stand this
day all of you before the Lord your G-d," which means that the nation as
a whole, if it wishes, may stand before the Eternal to fulfill the
Torah. But should it refuse to do so, then, just as it was coerced into
accepting the covenant at Mount Sinai, it will be compelled by force to
fulfill the Torah and to stand before the Eternal.

The secret things belong to the
Lord our G-d; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our
children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.

</p>    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><span class="c1">
And it appears to our master that this verse may be explained according
to the words of the Hatam Sofer in the last responsum on Yoreh Dei'ah,
in which he questioned deeply to find out from where we know that the
coming of the Messiah is one of the basic tenets of the faith. For
concerning the ten tribes it is said (Deuteronomy 29:28) "and cast them
into another land, as at this day" (וַיַּשְׁלִכֵם אֶל אֶרֶץ אַחֶרֶת כַּיּוֹם הַזֶּה), 
which the Sages of the Talmud interpret to mean that
just as this day does not return, so, too, the ten tribes will never
return. Shall we say that the ten tribes, on that account, would be
exempt from their obligation to fulfill the commandments of the Torah?
And is it our duty to enjoy the benefits of the Torah? On the contrary,
it is our obligation to make the will of the Eternal our desire. That is
why after the Scripture writes "and cast them into another land" from
which we infer that the ten tribes will never return, the Scripture then
says: "The secret things belong to the Lord our G-d," which means that
we should not question what will become of us or what our end will be if
we do not return to our land, but instead remain in the diaspora for
ever. The Scripture continues: "but the things that are revealed belong
to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this
law," which means that even if the Eternal does not return our remnant
forever, it is still incumbent upon us to fulfill all the words of this
Torah whatever the trustworthy G-d decides to do with us.
