   And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be G-d's
   house (Genesis 28:22)

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  
  See Rashi and the Ramban, who each in his own way, explains the
  words "shall be G-d's house" (יִהְיֶה בֵּית אֱלֹקִים). But whoever
  reflects about these commentaries will see that their explanations
  are forced. And see how Rashi, the Ramban, and Ibn Ezra, commenting
  on the verse in פרשת שופאים "And you shall not set up a pillar
  which the Lord your G-d hates" (Deuteronomy 16:22), explain how
  Jacob could have erected a pillar.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  But our master suggested a new interpretation, which is that Jacob
  our father saved himself from any transgression in erecting this
  pillar by saying that it should be the house of G-d, and not a
  pillar which G-d hates. For the difference between a pillar and an
  altar (מזבח), as the Ramban explains here, is that a pillar is a
  single stone and an altar is built with many stones. But the pillar
  that Jacob erected was also from many stones, because Jacob had
  taken "from the stones of the place" (מאבני המקום), and they
  were transformed miraculously into a single stone, according to the
  explanation of Hazal which is quoted here by Rashi. Jacob therefore
  said "and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be
  G-d's house," and G-d will not hate it because it was made from many
  stones.

      And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name
      Reuben, for she said, "Surely the Lord has looked upon my
      affliction (Genesis 29:32) 
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  Rashi comments that our Sages explained (Berahot 7b) that she said,
  "see (רְאוּ) the difference between (בֵּן) my son and the son of my
  father-in-law. The son of my father-in-law voluntarily sold his
  birthright, for it is written: "And he sold his birthright unto
  Jacob." And, nonetheless, behold, it is written of him: "And Esau
  hated Jacob," and it is also written: "And he said, is not he
  rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times." My
  son, however, although Joseph took his birthright from him against
  his will -- as it is written: "But, for as much as he defiled his
  father's couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph,"
  -- was not jealous of him. For it is written: "And Reuben heard it,
  and delivered him out of their hand."

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  And the question arises what prompted the Sages to interpret the
  name Reuben in this way and why they did not accept the explicit
  statement of the Scripture that she named him Reuben because G-d saw
  her affliction.

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  And it appears to our master that while the names of all the other
  sons of Jacob are recorded only after the reason for the name is
  given, here the Scripture first records the name and then provides
  the reason for the name. So it must be that Leah had another hidden
  reason, which she did not want to reveal. And that is the reason
  given by our Sages: "see the difference between my son and the son
  of my father-in-law." But she was not permitted to disclose this
  reason, just as Isaac was not permitted to disclose to Jacob what
  had happened to Joseph. She therefore had to state a different
  reason for the name, which is the one recorded by the Scripture.

  Thus has G-d has taken away the sheep of your father, and
	    given them to me (Genesis 31:9)
</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">
  It may be questioned why the Scripture writes "אֲבִיכֶם" which is a
  masculine form, when elsewhere it writes the appropriate feminine
  form "אֲבִיכֶן". And the explanation of our master is based upon the
  Scripture below (31:14): "Is there any portion or inheritance left
  to us in our father's house?" (הַעוֹד לָנוּ חֵלֶק וְנַחֲלָה בְּבֵית אָבִינוּ) Rashi
  understands this to mean, "Can we at all hope to inherit anything
  belonging to our father together with his sons?" This appears
  difficult, for the law is that daughters do not inherit when there
  are also sons. So why were Rachel and Leah complaining?

</span></p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><span class="c1">

  However, based on the verse (Genesis 29:6): "It is well, and,
  behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the flock," 
  (הֲשָׁלוֹם לוֹ וַיֹּאמְרוּ שָׁלוֹם וְהִנֵּה רָחֵל בִּתּוֹ בָּאָה עִם הַצֹּאן)
  one could offer an answer
  according to the opinion that Laban originally had no sons and had
  no one that would tend his sheep. For Laban to be well, i.e., to be
  at peace, it was necessary to be separated from him completely, and
  to have no ties with him at all, just as a pot makes peace between
  fire and water by separating them so that they are not in contact,
  since fire and water cannot coexist. Only in that way, was peace
  with Laban was possible. And this is confirmed by the fact that his
  daughter Rachel was tending the sheep even though it is not
  customary for females to be shepherds, because Laban would not rely
  on any outsider to tend to his sheep. So if his daughters did men's
  work for him by tending to his sheep, they at least deserved to take
  a portion of Laban's inheritance that was equal to that of the
  younger sons, who had done nothing to help Laban accumulate his
  fortune. That is why Jacob said, "G-d has taken away the cattle of
  your father, and given them to me" using the masculine form of your
  father (אֲבִיכֶם), to indicate that in reference to the cattle that
  G-d gave him, Rachel and Leah were considered as males who were
  entitled to an inheritance, inasmuch as it was they, not Laban's
  sons, who had toiled for it as if they were males. And, on account
  of their toil, G-d gave Jacob the cattle of Laban.
