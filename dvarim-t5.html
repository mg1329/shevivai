In the Midrash (Deuteronomy Rabbah 1:1) it is written:
Before Moses was privileged to receive the Torah, the Scripture writes
about him (Exodus 4:10): "I am not a man of words" 
(לֹא אִישׁ דְּבָרִים אָנֹכִי). But after he acquired the Torah, his speech defect was cured
and he began to speak "words" (דְּבָרִים). From where do we know this?
From what we read on this topic: "These are the words which Moses spoke."
</span></p><p><span class="c1">      
Now it may be asked: were not all the Israelites cured of their ailments
when the Torah was given? What then was noteworthy about Moses? Our
master explained that Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, never
wanted, owing to his extreme modesty, to be a ruler who would lead the
Children of Israel. Nor did he ever presume in his heart to become one
who would reprove the people. That is why he said "I am not a man of
words" who could, in his own words, speak harshly to the multitudes and
scold his people concerning their iniquities and the House of Jacob
about their transgressions.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
However, after Moses received the Torah, he was able to reprove them
without affronting them, for he could say to them: "This is what is
written in the Torah. This is what you should do and this is what you
should not do." As the Rabbis said in the Talmud, "if one's father or
teacher transgresses a commandment in the Torah" (so that it would be
disrespectful to reprove them directly) "he should say, 'so has our
master taught us' or 'Father, this is what is written in the Torah.'" By
speaking in this way, he does not disgrace them.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
So it was with Moses. Before he received the Torah, its laws and
statutes, Moses could reprove the people only with words of his own
choosing. And because he was so modest, Moses said "I am not a man of
words that I should raise my voice to rebuke others." But when he
received the Torah, he raised his voice like a shofar, and he said to
them, "such and such has G-d commanded." It is therefore appropriately
written: "These are the words which Moses spoke."

Rashi comments:
They said to him: Moses, are you setting a limit on our blessings? Has
the Holy One Blessed Be He not already promised us (Genesis 13:16) "if a
man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered?" (אֲשֶׁר אִם יוּכַל אִישׁ לִמְנוֹת אֶת עֲפַר הָאָרֶץ גַּם זַרְעֲךָ יִמָּנֶה). He replied. This (i.e., a thousand times) is my own blessing.
But He will bless you as He has promised.
</span></p><p><span class="c1">
It may be asked: Was the thousand-fold blessing that Moses gave them
insufficient? Does this not imply a prodigious number of people (six
billion) that has never been observed before or since? And it appears to
our master that we know that everything that lives and grows in this
world does not forever remain stable, but rather goes from one extreme
to the other and its course proceeds either upward or downward. Thus,
whatever reaches its maximum point must then necessarily turn downward,
diminishing until it vanishes entirely. Because he said "a thousand
times thus," the people said to Moses: "Have you set a limit upon our
blessings, in which case you have placed a bound upon how much we can
ascend?" And should they reach that limit, they must fall backwards and
descend into oblivion as has happened to many nations that became great
and successful, and whose heads reached the clouds. But after they
reached the highest peak, they began to fall to the deepest valley. They
were lost and annihilated and no trace is left of them. Is that not why,
when the Eternal blessed the Children of Israel, He said (Genesis
32:13): "as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude"
(כְּחוֹל הַיָּם אֲשֶׁר לֹא יִסָּפֵר מֵרֹב) and did not place a limit to
their blessing? This was a hint that Israel would survive forever, would
live everlastingly, and would never see destruction, inasmuch as they
would never reach the maximum point of the blessing that the Eternal had
given them. That is why they complained that Moses had placed a limit on
their blessing. And his response was "this (a thousand times) is my own
blessing," by which he meant a thousand times is a prodigious number
that they will never approach and they will never reach the maximum
point from which there must be decline and destruction. However, because
Moses was a finite being, he could speak only in finite terms. But the
Holy One Blessed Be He, the G-d of the universe, Who is infinite, spoke
in terms that were infinite. But both of them had intended just one
thing: that destruction shall never come upon Israel and they shall
always see light.
